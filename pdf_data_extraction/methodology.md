## **Methodology Overview**

This semester we are focusing on the data sources that can be easily extracted (e.g., PDFs) from the [list of data sets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1neIGtYK0Wm3jK_5MzYZ0Bz30MBtzOQEl/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107628387210962426482&rtpof=true&sd=true) provided to us. The idea is to create a Proof of Concept quick and add on more data sources as this project progresses over time. 

As a team we went through the data set list and found sources that had portable data (like PDFs) and listed them in a running [google doc file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18X8ujDmUIF2j7fee9prRHqn8mgFCEeCYRTwZNAdwrYk/edit?usp=sharing). 

We then created a [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zN2oIfehRqHIE2PAOKmM6eacIt0_Nnph?usp=drive_link) called `Extracted Data` in our project drive to collect and store all the extracted data. 
- This folder will be constantly updated throughout the project lifecycle to add more and recent data sources as laws and regulations change. 
- As of March 5, 2025 we have a very small number of PDFs extracted and stored in here. 
- We aim to add more data the coming weeks!
