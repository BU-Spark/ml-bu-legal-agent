MassLegalHelp.org/LT-\\nSecurity-Deposits\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\nChapter 3\\nSecurity Deposits &\\nLast Month\\'s Rent\\nby Gary Allen Italicized words are in the Glossary\\nThe Massachusetts security deposit law protects both you and your landlord.1\\nOnce you agree to rent a place, your landlord can charge you a security\\ndeposit to protect their property from any damage you might cause. They can\\nalso charge you last month’s rent to protect themselves if you move out\\nbefore paying it.\\nThis chapter explains your rights if your landlord charges you a security\\ndeposit, last month’s rent or both.\\nThe most important thing you can do to protect yourself is to get written\\nreceipts from your landlord for the security deposit and last month’s rent.\\nOnly give your landlord cash if they give you a receipt right away.\\nHow Much Can a Landlord Request\\nWhen you first move in, your landlord may only charge you:\\na security deposit,\\nfirst month\\'s rent,\\nlast month\\'s rent, and\\nthe cost of a new lock and key.2\\nA security deposit or a last month’s rent cannot be more than the amount of\\nyour 1st month’s rent.\\nExample:\\nIf the 1st month’s rent is $1,000, a landlord can charge:\\n$1,000 security deposit\\n$1,000 1st month’s rent\\n$1,000 last month’s rent\\n+ $........the cost of lock and key\\n= Total a landlord can charge\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\n1. Security Deposit\\nA security deposit and last month\\'s rent are not the same.\\nA security deposit is money you pay a landlord to protect them in case you\\ndamage the apartment. But a security deposit is your money. If you do not\\ndamage the property and don’t owe any rent when you vacate, you generally\\nare entitled to get your full deposit back within 30 days after you leave.\\n(There are a couple exceptions, see When Can I Get My Security Deposit\\nBack - When your tenancy ends.\\nYour landlord must keep your security deposit in a bank account in\\nMassachusetts. The account must be separate from the account they keep\\ntheir own money in. And every year they must pay you the interest it earns.\\n2. Last Month\\'s Rent\\nLast month\\'s rent protects your landlord in advance if you leave and do not\\npay rent the last month you are there.\\nYour landlord does not have to keep your last month\\'s rent money in a\\nseparate bank account. But they do have to pay you interest on it every year.\\nIf you pay last month\\'s rent in advance, do not expect to get this money back\\nwhen you move out. It will pay for your last month.\\nIf you do not pay last month’s rent in advance, you must pay for your last\\nmonth of rent even if a landlord holds a security deposit.\\n3. Illegal Fees\\nIt is against the law for a landlord to charge tenants any other “moving in”\\nfees, like:\\n▪ application or holding deposits,\\n▪ amenity or community fees,\\n▪ up-front pet fees,\\n▪ cleaning fees, or\\n▪ credit checks or application fees.3\\nIt is also illegal for a landlord to charge you a finder’s fee. But if a real\\nestate broker or salesperson – not the landlord – helps you find your rental\\nunit, that person may charge you a “finder\\'s or broker’s fee.” A broker or\\nsalesperson can charge a finder\\'s fee only if they are licensed in the state of\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\nMassachusetts. The broker or salesperson must provide a written notice to\\nprospective tenants with information about the fee and whether or not it is\\npaid if a tenancy is not created. 4 To find out if an agent is licensed, go to the\\ninternet at: www.mass.gov/how-to/check-an-occupational-board-license and\\nclick on \"Check a License.\"\\nIf a landlord tries to charge you an illegal fee:\\n▪ You can refuse to pay it.\\n▪ You do not have to rent from that landlord. Find a landlord who\\nfollows the law.\\n▪ If you do rent from that landlord, get a written, itemized receipt for\\neverything you pay. Make sure the receipt, includes the extra fees and\\nwhat they are for. After you move in, subtract the amount you paid in\\nillegal fees from your rent. Write the landlord a letter that says you\\nhave subtracted the illegal fees from the rent. Include the itemized\\nreceipt.\\n4. Discrimination\\nA landlord that charges a fee or security deposit to some groups of people\\nand does not charge the same fee or deposit to others may be breaking the\\ndiscrimination laws. It is illegal for a landlord to discriminate against groups\\nthe law protects, including: single parents, people of color, people on welfare,\\npeople with small children, people with disabilities, and people with Section\\n8 or other rental assistance. If the landlord tries to discriminate against you,\\nsee Chapter 7: Discrimination.\\n5. Illegal Lease Clauses\\nYour landlord cannot take away your rights under the security deposit law by\\nusing a written lease that conflicts with the law. “Your landlord can keep\\nyour security deposit if you rent the apartment for less than 6 months,” is an\\nexample of an illegal clause. Your landlord cannot do this.\\nIf your landlord has you sign a lease with a clause that conflicts with the\\nsecurity deposit law, you have the right to get your security deposit back as\\nsoon you ask for it. See Getting Back Your Security Deposit.5\\n6. Increases in Deposits\\nAfter you move in, a landlord might seek to increase your security deposit\\nand last month’s rent deposit. Some landlords will demand that you pay\\nincreased amounts for either or both the security deposit or the last month\\'s\\nrent if you agree to a rent increase.\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\nIf you agree to a new tenancy with a higher rent, the landlord may be\\npermitted to increase the security deposit and last month’s rent. To create a\\nnew tenancy, the prior tenancy must be terminated. This can happen either\\nautomatically by the terms in your lease or agreement or the landlord must\\nsend a written notice of termination of tenancy.\\nIf you decide to pay the increased security deposit and last month’s rent, the\\namounts for either cannot be greater than the amount of the new rent. If you\\nare unable to pay the higher amounts immediately, another approach would\\nbe to negotiate with your landlord to pay the increase over a period of time.\\nKeep good records of all payments to protect your rights.\\nYour Landlord\\'s Responsibilities\\nIf your landlord charges you a security deposit, last month’s rent, or both,\\nthey must:\\n1. Give you written receipts.\\n2. Give you a statement that describes the condition of your apartment, if\\nthey take a security deposit.6\\n3. Keep your security deposit in a separate bank account in\\nMassachusetts.\\n4. Pay you interest every year on both your security deposit and last\\nmonth’s rent.7\\n5. Keep records of security deposits and repairs.8\\n6. Return your security deposit to you at the end of your tenancy if there\\nis no damage and your rent is paid.\\n7. Return your security deposit to you if they fail to follow the security\\ndeposit law.\\n1. Written Receipts\\nThe most important step you can take when you move in is to get a complete\\nreceipt from your landlord that spells out all the money you gave them and\\nwhat it is for.\\nOnly give your landlord cash if they give you a receipt right away. If the\\nlandlord refuses to give you a written receipt, use Security Deposit Receipt\\nand Last Month’s Receipt (Form 4).\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\nYou should get several kinds of documents from your landlord. They must all\\nbe written.\\n▪ 1st Receipt: They must give you a written receipt when you give them\\nyour security deposit or last month’s rent.9\\n▪ 2nd Receipt: If the landlord receives a security deposit, they have 30\\ndays to put your security deposit in a bank and give you a 2nd receipt.\\nThis receipt must say where your security deposit is.10\\n▪ Annual Statement: Every year they must give you a statement with\\nthe amount of interest you are owed on your security deposit and last\\nmonth\\'s rent.11 Each receipt or statement about your security deposit or\\nlast month’s rent must include:\\n1st Receipt for security deposit or Security Last\\nDeposit Month\\'s\\nlast month’s rent\\nRent\\nAmount of money received ✓ ✓\\nDate money was received ✓ ✓\\nWhat the money is for ✓ ✓\\nName of landlord ✓ ✓\\nName of person you give the money to if different\\n✓ ✓\\nfrom landlord\\nStatement that you are owed interest on the money ✓\\nStatement that you should give a forwarding address\\n✓\\nso landlord can send you interest when you move\\n2nd Receipt within 30 days for Security Last\\nDeposit Month’s\\nsecurity deposit in a Mass bank\\nRent\\nLocation and name of bank where your money is ✓\\nNo receipt\\nAmount and account number of the account where\\n✓ required\\nyour money is\\nAnnual statement at the end of each\\nLast\\nSecurity\\nyear for security deposit or last Month\\'s\\nDeposit\\nRent\\nmonth’s rent\\nStatement of the amount of interest you are owed on ✓\\n✓\\nyour deposit\\nWhen it comes to the security deposit receipts, if the landlord does not give\\nyou the right written information at the right time, you may have the right to\\nget your security deposit back. See Getting Your Security Deposit Back.\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\n2. Statement of Condition\\nAs soon as you move in, examine the rental unit right away. If anything is\\nnot in good condition, make notes about it and take photos. Make sure to put\\na date on your notes and photos.\\nIf your landlord charged you a security deposit, they have 10 days after you\\nmove in to give you a description of your rental unit’s condition. This\\ndescription must be in writing. It is called a “Statement of Condition.” 12\\nThis Statement must list all the existing damage in your apartment when you\\nmove in. It must also cover the common areas of the place you are renting. Its\\npurpose is to prevent disputes between you and your landlord when you\\nmove out. The statement makes clear the damage already there when you\\nmoved in. The Statement of condition must contain very specific language,\\nand your landlord must also sign this Statement.\\nThe statement must say:\\n“This is a statement of the condition of the premises you have leased or\\nrented. You should read it carefully in order to see if it is correct. If it is\\ncorrect you must sign it. This will show that you agree that the list is\\ncorrect and complete. If it is not correct, you must attach a separate\\nsigned list of any damage which you believe exists in the premises. This\\nstatement must be returned to the lessor or his agent within fifteen days\\nafter you receive this list or within fifteen days after you move in,\\nwhichever is later. If you do not return this list, within the specified time\\nperiod, a court may later view your failure to return the list as your\\nagreement that the list is complete and correct in any suit which you may\\nbring to recover the security deposit.\\'\\'\\nRead the Statement of Condition carefully. Take time to walk through the\\napartment with the Statement. Use Housing Code Checklist (Booklet 2) to\\nhelp you understand what the law requires.\\nIf a landlord writes on the Statement of Condition that there are no bad\\nconditions, make sure this is true. If there are things that are not in good\\ncondition, write them on the landlord’s Statement so it describes the real\\ncondition of the place. Add even small defects to your list like holes in the\\nwalls and windows that do not work well. This is to protect you when you\\nmove out.\\nYou can also use our Statement of Condition (Form 3) and attach it to the\\nlandlord’s “Statement.”\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\na. Send the Statement to the Landlord\\nYou have 15 days after you get the landlord’s Statement of Condition to send\\nit back. You can:\\n▪ Make no changes to the “Statement,” sign it and send it back.\\n▪ Make changes, or attach your own statement, notes and photos, sign it\\nand send it back.\\nIf you do not send it back within 15 days, it means you agree completely with\\nthe landlord’s Statement.\\nIf you send your landlord a Statement of Condition with your own list of\\nproblems, your landlord must return a copy within 15 days. The landlord\\nmust say if they agree or disagree with what you wrote. And they must sign\\nthis statement too.\\nKeep a copy of everything you send the landlord.\\nb. If you do not get a Statement of Condition\\nIf you do not get a Statement of Condition within 10 days of moving and\\nthere are serious problems in your rental unit, do your own statement.13 You\\ncan use Statement of Condition (Form 3).\\nYour Statement of Condition is important. It can prevent the landlord from\\nusing your security deposit to pay for damage you did not cause.\\nc. Problems after you move in\\nIf there is a problem with your apartment after you move in, let the landlord\\nknow right away and ask them to repair it. It is best if you tell the landlord in\\nwriting, which can mean sending a letter, an email or a text message.\\nFor example, if you move in during August, you might not find out that the\\nheating system is broken until several months later.\\nIt is OK to call, but you have better protection if you put your request in\\nwriting.\\nKeep a copy of the letter or email or text message so you can always prove\\nthat you notified the landlord about a problem.\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\n3. Separate Bank Account\\na. Security Deposit\\nA security deposit is your money that the landlord is holding.14 If your\\nlandlord charged you a security deposit, they must keep your security deposit\\nin a bank account in Massachusetts.15\\nThe account must be separate from the landlord’s money. The name on the\\naccount must make it clear that the money does not belong to the landlord.\\nThe bank account must also be protected from creditors.16\\nIf a landlord fails to keep your money in a separate account protected from\\ncreditors, you have the right to sue your landlord for 3 times the amount of\\nyour deposit.17 See Getting Back Your Security Deposit.\\nb. Last Month’s Rent\\nIf your landlord charged you last month’s rent, they do not have to put it into\\na separate account. But once a year they must still pay you interest owed on\\nit.\\n4. Payment of Interest\\nIf your landlord charged you a security deposit or last month’s rent, they\\nmust pay you the interest that the money earns.\\na. Amount\\nThe landlord must give you all the interest your security deposit and last\\nmonth’s rent earn if the bank pays less than 5% interest.18\\nb. When\\nYour landlord must pay the interest you are owed on your security deposit\\nand last month’s rent:\\n▪ Once a year, and\\n▪ Within 30 days after you move out.19\\nc. Yearly payment\\nAfter each 12-month rental period, your landlord must send you a statement\\nthat tells you:\\n▪ The bank, bank address, and account number that holds your security\\ndeposit and,\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\n▪ The interest you are owed on the security deposit and last month’s\\nrent.\\nAt the same time, the landlord must either:\\n▪ Give you the interest you are owed, or\\n▪ Explain in this statement that you can subtract the interest from your\\nnext rent.20\\nIf 30 days pass after the 12-month rental period and you have not received\\neither the interest or the statement, you may subtract the interest owed\\nfrom your next rent payment.21 It is a good idea to include a letter with\\nyour rent payment that explains you are subtracting this interest from your\\nrent payment.\\nHow to subtract yearly interest from rent payment\\nYou pay a $1,000 security deposit and a $1,000 last month\\'s rent\\npayment. The interest on the account is 1%,\\nYour landlord must pay you a total of $20 in interest ($10 for the\\nsecurity deposit and $10 for the last month’s rent) for every year\\nthat you rent.\\nIf the landlord does not pay you directly, you may subtract this\\n$20 from your rent payment.\\n1. If Interest is 1% on Your Security Deposit and Last\\nMonth\\'s Rent\\n$1,000 Security Deposit $1,000 Last Month Rent\\nx .01 Interest x .01 Interest\\n$10 = Amount owed $10 = Amount Owed\\n2. Subtract Total Interest Owed from Your Rent\\n$1,000 Rent\\n- $20 Total interest owed tenant on security deposit & last month\\'s rent\\n$ 980 = Amount of next rent check\\nd. Moving out\\nIf your landlord does not pay you the interest you are owed on your security\\ndeposit within 30 days of the day you move out, or the last day of your lease,\\nyou can sue the landlord for 3 times the amount of the interest owed.\\nIf you win in court, you also have the right to have the landlord pay your\\nlawyer’s fees and court costs.22 See How to get your security deposit back.\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\n5. Records of Deposits and Repairs\\nYour landlord must keep security deposit and repair records for all tenants\\nwho have moved in or out in the last 2 years.23 The records must show:\\n▪ A detailed description of any damage in an apartment when the\\nlandlord took a security deposit;\\n▪ When repairs were made; and\\n▪ Receipts and the cost of any repairs.\\nAnyone interested in renting has the right to see these records during normal\\noffice hours.24\\nIf you already paid a security deposit and your landlord refuses to let you see\\nthe records, you have the right to an immediate refund of your security\\ndeposit.25\\n6. Returning Your Security Deposit\\nIf you leave your rental unit in the same condition as you found it (except for\\nnormal wear and tear), the landlord must return your entire security deposit\\nand any interest they owe you on it. The security deposit and interest belong\\nto you.\\nIf you have a written lease, a landlord has until 30 days after the last day of\\nyour lease to return the deposit, even if you move out before the lease ends.26\\nIf you do not have a written lease, your landlord has until 30 days of when\\nyour tenancy ends. See When Can I Get My Security Deposit Back -\\nWhen your tenancy ends.\\n7. Following the Law\\nYour landlord must follow the security deposit law. If they do not, they must\\nreturn your entire security deposit when you ask for it. The landlord has\\nfailed to follow the law if they:\\n▪ Do not give you a complete receipt within 30 days of getting your\\ndeposit, see Written Receipts.\\n▪ Fail to put the security deposit in a separate bank account, see\\nSeparate Bank Account.27\\n▪ Do not let you inspect their records of deposits and repairs, see\\nRecords of Deposits and Repairs.28\\n▪ Ask you orally or in writing to give up your security deposit rights.\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\n▪ Fail to transfer your security deposit to a new owner, see New\\nOwners.\\n▪ Do not give you an itemized list of damages within 30 days after you\\nmove out; or\\n▪ Do not return your deposit or any balance owed you, with interest,\\nwithin 30 days of when you tenancy ends.29 See When Can I Get My\\nSecurity Deposit Back - When your tenancy ends.\\nIf your landlord does not follow the law, you can ask them to return your\\nsecurity deposit - even if you are still living in the apartment. See Security\\nDeposit Demand Letter (Form 5).\\nGetting Your Security Deposit Back\\n1. What Can My Security Deposit Be Used For\\na.

How Do I Protect My Security Deposit\\nBefore I Move Out\\n▪ Give your landlord an address where they can send the security deposit\\nand any interest.\\n▪ Take photos of all rooms in case you need to prove the condition of the\\napartment when you moved out.\\n▪ Ask the landlord to inspect the apartment with you and to point out\\nany damage they plan to subtract from your security deposit.\\n▪ Have your Statement of Condition with you in case you need to show\\nthe landlord that the problem existed when you moved in. See\\nStatement of Condition (Form 3).\\n▪ If there is any damage that goes beyond “wear and tear,” make a list\\nthat you and your landlord can sign. You may be able to reach an\\nagreement with the landlord before you move out.\\n▪ If your landlord refuses to inspect the apartment, make your own list\\nof any damage or improvements. Sign and date it, then mail it to the\\nlandlord after you move out. Remember to put in an address where\\nthe landlord can send the security deposit.\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\n4. How Do I Get My Security Deposit Back?\\nIf your landlord does not return your security deposit when they should or\\nthey fail to follow the law, you can send the landlord a demand letter.\\nIf you send a demand letter and they still do not return your security deposit,\\nyou can take the landlord to court.\\na. Demand Letter\\nYou can use a demand letter whenever you have the right to an immediate\\nreturn of your deposit, even if it is not at the end of your tenancy.39\\nA demand letter gives your landlord a chance to return your deposit without\\nhaving to go to court. You can use our Sample Demand Letters (Form 5 or\\nForm 6)\\nSend the letter by certified mail, return receipt requested. Keep a copy for\\nyour records.\\nIf your landlord does not respond to your demand letter for the return of your\\nsecurity deposit, you can take them to court. You can ask the court for up to 3\\ntimes the amount of the deposit, plus interest. If your security deposit was\\n$1,000, the landlord may have to pay you $3,000, plus interest, plus your\\ncourt fees. If you hire a lawyer, the landlord will also have to pay your\\nlawyer’s fees.40 See Triple Damages.\\nFor more information about demand letters go to\\nwww.mass.gov/ago/consumer-resources/consumer-assistance/93a-demand-\\nletter.html.\\nb. Taking Your Landlord to Court\\nYou can take your landlord to court if they:\\n▪ Fails to respond to your demand letter;\\n▪ Fails to return your security deposit, with interest, within 30 days of\\nthe day you move out, or 30 days of the last day of your lease;\\n▪ Fails to give you a complete list of damages within 30 days after you\\nmove out;\\n▪ Failed to give you a complete receipt within 30 days of your giving the\\nlandlord a security deposit when you first moved in.\\n▪ Failed to put the money in a separate bank account that is protected\\nfrom creditors;\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\n▪ Failed to transfer a security deposit to a new owner; or\\n▪ Asked you to give up your rights orally or in writing.\\nYou can sue for up to $7,000 in Small Claims court. If your security deposit\\nwas less than $7,000, you can sue for 3 times the deposit, even though 3\\ntimes that amount may be more than $7,000.\\nYou can also sue the landlord for any interest they did not pay you during\\nyour tenancy and for the amount of money you have to pay an attorney to\\nrepresent you.41\\nIf you sue your landlord for your security deposit and they did not give you a\\ncomplete list of damages within 30 days of your tenancy ending, they cannot\\nclaim you caused damage to the apartment. If the landlord wants to sue you\\nfor damage to the apartment, they must start a separate case.42\\nThe landlord is not allowed to keep any part of your deposit unless she sends\\nyou the list of damage and repairs within 30 days of the day you move out.43\\nc. Triple Damages\\nIf you go to court, the court must award 3 times your security deposit if the\\ncourt finds that your landlord has failed to:\\n▪ Properly deposit a security deposit in a bank account separate from the\\nlandlord\\'s funds and protected from creditors;44\\n▪ Transfer a security deposit to a new owner; or\\n▪ Return the security deposit or balance that you have a right to within\\n30 days of the end of your tenancy.45\\nd. Where to file\\nMost security deposit cases can be filed as a Small Claims case. Housing\\nCourts, District Courts, and the Boston Municipal Court all have Small\\nClaims sessions.\\nThe Massachusetts Court website has lots of information about Small Claims\\nand forms in multiple languages that you can use at:\\nwww.mass.gov/courts/selfhelp/small-claims/.\\nAlso, the Massachusetts state website has additional information about Small\\nClaims laws in Massachusetts at:\\nwww.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-law-about-small-claims-and-\\nbringing-a-claim-to-court\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\nIf you win a Small Claims case, the landlord can appeal. Most landlords do\\nnot appeal. To appeal, the landlord has to give the court a “bond” to start the\\nappeal. The amount of the bond is 3 times the security deposit.46 This law is\\nto keep the landlord from using the court to tie up your security deposit in a\\nlengthy lawsuit.\\nWhy Is There a Security Deposit Law\\nIn 1975, Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group\\n(MassPIRG) proved that landlords were keeping tenants’ deposits\\nillegally, forcing tenants to sue to get them back. If a tenant sued and\\nwon, they could recover the amount of the deposit and court fees, but\\nnothing more. For most tenants, it was not worth the cost and effort of\\nsuing. Dishonest landlords knew this and had no reason to obey the\\nlaw. The worst punishment they could face was to be ordered to pay\\nthe deposit they should have paid in the first place.\\nBecause of this research, the state legislature made the security deposit\\nlaw stronger. Now, landlords who refuse to refund tenants the deposit\\nmoney within 30 days, if there is no damage, may have to pay 3 times\\nthe amount. MassPIRG is a non-profit agency.\\nNew Owners\\nYou should not lose your security deposit or last month\\'s rent payment if the\\nproperty is sold or foreclosed or if a new management company takes over.\\nYour landlord should forward your security deposit and last month’s rent to\\nthe new owner. But keep track of who the new owner is. If your landlord\\nloses the property to foreclosure, the bank may be the new owner, or a new\\nowner may buy the property.\\nThe new landlord has 45 days to send you a notice about your security\\ndeposit, last month’s rent, and interest owed.\\nIf the new landlord does not send you this notice by the deadline, the old\\nlandlord must return your deposit, plus interest.47\\nIf 45 days pass and you have not heard from the new landlord, write to the\\nold landlord to demand that they return your money, plus interest.48 See\\nSecurity Deposit Demand Letter for Tenants Moving Out (Form 6). If\\nthe old landlord does not return your money, you can sue them for 3 times\\nthe amount they owe you.49\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\nIf the new landlord asks you to pay another security deposit or last month’s\\nrent – Say, “No!”\\nThen send a letter to the new owner that says:\\n▪ You already paid the previous landlord, and\\n▪ The landlord was supposed to transfer all security deposits, payments\\nfor last month’s rent, and interest to the new owner.\\nUnder the law, a tenant cannot be made to pay a new or additional security\\ndeposit or last month\\'s rent payment because someone else has taken over the\\nbuilding.50 In most cases, the new owner is responsible for your security\\ndeposit, last month’s rent, and interest, even if they never received it from the\\nold landlord.51\\nWhen you move out, the new owner must pay you. Or they can let you live\\nrent-free for the time that represents the money they owe you.52\\nIf your old landlord lost the property to foreclosure and the new owner does\\nnot return the money you are owed, you may have to go to court to get it\\nback. See Foreclosures.\\nFor more information about security deposits and foreclosures, see Chapter\\n18: Tenants and Foreclosure – How to Get Your Security Deposit Back\\nAfter Foreclosure.\\nSubsidized Housing\\nIf you live in privately owned housing that is subsidized by a state or federal\\nhousing program, the landlord must follow the security deposit law. See\\nYour Landlord\\'s Responsibilities. But what the landlord can ask for\\ndepends on the type of subsidy you have.\\n1. Section 8 Housing Voucher\\nIf you have a Section 8 voucher under the Housing Choice Voucher Program\\nor the Project-Based Voucher program, your landlord may charge you a\\nsecurity deposit that is up to one full month’s rent.53 A full month is your\\nshare of the rent plus the amount the housing agency pays the landlord. If a\\nfull month’s rent is $1,000, a landlord could charge your $1,000 for a\\nsecurity deposit.\\nA landlord may also charge you last month’s rent in advance, but you would\\nhave to pay only your share of the rent. For example if the rent is $1,000 and\\nyour share is $300, a landlord can charge you only $300 for last month’s\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\nrent.54 The housing agency will pay its share of the last month’s rent the last\\nmonth you are there. It will not pay it in advance.\\nIf your share of the rent increases during your tenancy, the landlord may ask\\nfor the amount of the increase to add to the last month’s rent that they are\\nholding.55\\nWhen you move out, the landlord must return your security deposit if there is\\nno damage or unpaid rent. If there is property damage that you, a household\\nmember, or a guest caused or unpaid rent this may prevent you from getting\\nback your security deposit. You could also lose your voucher. For example:\\n▪ If a landlord claims that you have committed a serious or repeated\\nlease violation, which could be property damage, a housing agency\\ncould try to end or “terminate” your Section 8 voucher or it could\\nrefuse to issue you another voucher so that you can move;56\\n▪ If the housing agency that pays your voucher asks you to fix damage\\nthat you, a household member, or a guest caused within a set period of\\ntime, and if you don’t, the housing agency could try to end or\\n“terminate” your Section 8 voucher.57\\nThe best way to protect your security deposit and your voucher is to:\\n▪ Take steps listed in How Do I Protect My Security Deposit Before I\\nMove Out.\\n▪ Immediately tell the housing agency and the landlord that you have\\nmoved out if it is before your lease is over so that the housing agency\\nwill know to make the last payment.\\n▪ If you are at risk of losing your Section 8 voucher because of damage\\nor unpaid rent, you have a right to a hearing.58 Try to get help from a\\nlocal community organization or legal services.59\\n2. Section 8 Multifamily Housing (No Voucher)\\nIf you have \"project-based\" Section 8 assistance in privately owned\\nmultifamily housing (which is not a voucher), how much a landlord can\\ncharge for a security deposits can vary slightly depending upon the program.\\nThe best thing to do is to look at the lease.\\n▪ Some programs provide that the landlord can charge you whichever is\\ngreater: either $50 or your share of the rent plus utilities, which is\\ncalled the “Total Tenant Payment.”60 Example: If the monthly contract\\nrent is $1,000 with all utilities included and your share or “Total\\nTenant Payment” is $300, a landlord could charge you no more than\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\n$300 for a security deposit. If, on the other hand, your monthly rent\\nshare is $25, the landlord could charge you $50.\\n▪ Other programs provide that the landlord can charge you your share of\\nthe “Total Tenant Payment.” They do not have a minimum $50.61\\nThe federal Section 8 housing programs have no rules about last month’s\\nrent. But it is unlikely that a multifamily owner will require a last month’s\\nrent.\\n3. Massachusetts Rental Housing Assistance\\nIf you have a voucher funded by the Massachusetts Rental Voucher Program\\n(MRVP) or the Alternative Housing Voucher Program a landlord may charge\\nyou a security deposit that is up to one full month’s rent. A full month is\\nyour share of the rent plus the amount the housing agency pays the landlord.\\nThis should be stated in the lease.\\n4. Public Housing\\nFor federal public housing, the housing authority is allowed to charge a\\nsecurity deposit that is up to one full month’s rent.62 There is no requirement\\nthat a housing authority charge a security deposit in state public housing,\\nunless you ask to have a pet.63\\nThere are no regulations about last month’s rent in either state or federal\\npublic housing.\\nHelp with Deposits\\n1. Residential Assistance for Families in\\nTransition (RAFT)\\nRAFT is a government program that helps low-income families avoid\\nhomelessness. RAFT can be used to pay for security deposit, first and last\\nmonth’s rent, bank rent, or utility bills. You must have children living with\\nyou or have a disability. Currently, the most you can get from the program is\\n$7,000 in a 12-month period. You can apply for RAFT funds are your\\nregional Housing Education Center, or online at http://www.mass.gov/how-\\nto/apply-for-raft-emergency-help-for-housing-costs\\n2. HomeBASE\\nHomeBASE is a program that offers a fixed amount to homeless families\\nwith children and pregnant women who are eligible for the state’s Emergency\\nAssistance (EA) program. The purpose of HomeBASE is to prevent\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\nhomelessness or to help people moving out of an EA shelter. HomeBASE\\ncan be used for a variety of purposes including paying a security deposit, and\\nfirst and last month’s rent. Families moving into subsidized housing can use\\nHomeBASE for first month, last month rent, and security deposit.64\\nCurrently, HomeBASE provides up to $30,000 over a 2-year period. For\\nmore information go to: www.mass.gov/info-details/homebase.\\n3. Private Programs\\nSome towns have private funds to help people in their towns who have low\\nincomes. Ask at your local church or town hall. You may be able to get some\\nhelp from the Red Cross or the Salvation Army.\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\nEndnotes\\n1. G.L. c. 186, §15B applies to most landlords. The security deposit law does not apply to\\nlandlords who rent places for seasonal or vacation purposes for 100 days or less. See\\nG.L. c. 186, §15B(9). The security deposit law also does not apply “to a foreclosing\\nmortgagee or a mortgagee in possession which is a financial institution chartered by the\\ncommonwealth or the United States.” See G.L. c. 186, §15B(5)\\n2. G.L. c. 186, §15B(1)(b).\\n3. Under G.L. c. 186, §15B(1)(b), the law is clear that a landlord can charge only first\\nmonth\\'s rent, last month\\'s rent, a security deposit, and the cost of a new lock. A landlord\\ncannot try to escape the requirements of the security deposit law by taking what is really\\na security deposit and calling it a “cleaning fee” or something else. Perry v. Equity\\nResidential Management, LLC, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, Civil\\nAction No. 12-10779-RWZ (August 26, 2014) (G.L. 186, §15B(1)(b) does not authorize\\nlandlords to charge prospective tenants an application fee, amenity fee, a community fee\\nor an upfront pet fee). Where the landlord seems to be adding a charge that bears no\\nrelation to any real work or cost, consult the Consumer Protection Act, G.L. c. 93A, §§2\\nand 9, and its regulations, 940 C.M.R. §3.17.\\n4. A rental agent can charge a \"finder\\'s fee\" only if they are a licensed real estate broker or\\nsalesperson. G.L. c. 112, §87DDD½ and 254 C.M.R. §7.00(1) and 940 C.M.R. §3.17.\\n5. G.L. c. 186, §15B(6)(c), (8). If a landlord has a tenant sign a lease that violates the\\nsecurity deposit law but doesn\\'t try to enforce the illegal terms, they may still be in\\nviolation of the Consumer Protection Act even though the landlord is not subject to\\npenalties under the security deposit law, 940 C.M.R. §3.17(3)(a)(1) and (4)(k).\\n6. In Tringali v. O’Leary, No. 15-ADMS-1003, Appellate Division of the District Court\\nDepartment Northern Division (June 30, 2105) the court found that the landlord had\\nviolated the provision of the security deposit law that required the landlord to provide\\nthe tenant with a written statement of conditions at the inception of the tenancy and had\\nfailed to provide the tenant with annual interest on their security deposit. Citing G.L. c.\\n239, 8A, the court also held that the lower court erred in awarding possession to the\\nlandlord where the tenant obtained a money judgment in an amount greater than what\\nthe landlord owed the tenant.\\n7. See Tringali v. O’Leary in endnote 7, where landlord failed to provide the tenant with\\nannual interest on their security deposit.\\n8. G.L. c. 186, § 15B(2)(d).\\n9. G.L. c. 186, § 15B(2)(a) and (b).\\n10. G.L. c. 186, § 15B(3)(a).\\n11. Security Deposit: G.L. c. 186, §15B(3)(b). Last Month’s Rent: G.L. c. 186,\\n§15B(2)(a). This section requires interest to be paid no matter how long you remain as a\\ntenant. Interest does not accrue during the last month of your tenancy.\\n12. G.L. c. 186, § 15B(2)(c).\\n13. 940 C.M.R. §3.17(4)(e). Because the landlord\\'s right to take a security deposit is\\nconditioned on providing the Statement of Condition, G.L. c. 186, §15B(1)(b)(iii), you\\nmay demand the deposit back if the landlord does not comply. However, most tenants\\nwill choose as a tactical matter not to make this a bone of contention at the very\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\nbeginning of a tenancy. While the security deposit statute does not state a specific\\npenalty for this particular violation, such is a violation of M.G.L. c. 93A. See Attorney\\nGeneral’s Consumer Protection Regulations 940 CMR 3.17 (4)(e) if the landlord is in\\nthe trade or commerce of renting residential property and therefore subject to damages\\nof the greater of actual damages or $25.00.\\n14. G.L. c. 186, § 15B(1)(e).\\n15. G.L. c. 186 §15B(1)(e), (3)(a). Placing the money in an out-of-state bank does not\\nconform to the statute. Taylor v. Burke, 69 Mass. App. Ct. 77, 86 (2007). “[P]rovisions\\nare designed to recognize the ownership of the deposit by the tenant and the landlord’s\\nduty to hold the monies in trust.” Id. at 84.\\n16. G.L. c. 186, §15B(1)(e), (3)(a). See also Neihaus v. Maxwell, 54 Mass App Ct 558\\n(2002), 560-61, where landlord’s method of holding security deposits for all of tenants\\nin a single account in Massachusetts separately designated as a “Security Deposit\\nAccount” did not violate the security deposit law. “The security deposit provisions\\nof G.L. c. 186, § 15B, are designed to insure that tenant monies are protected from\\npotential diversion to the personal use of the landlord, earn interest for the tenant, and\\nare kept from the reach of the landlord\\'s creditors.” Karaa v. Kuk Yim, 86 Mass. App.\\nCt. 714 (2014) further found that the failure of tenants to provide a Social Security\\nnumber did not preclude the landlord from establishing a separate account in\\ncompliance with §15B.\\n17. G.L. c. 186, §15B(7). The tenant is entitled to an award by the court of treble damages\\nfor this violation. The penalty is not discretionary. The tenant does not need to prove\\nthat the landlord acted in bad faith or that the tenant lost money because of the landlord\\'s\\nactions. Mellor v. Berman, 390 Mass. 275, 283 (1983). Note: Not all violations of G.L.\\nc. 186, §15B provide for triple damages.\\n18. G.L. c. 186, §15B(3)(b).\\n19. Security Deposit: G.L. c. 186, §15B(3)(b). The statute leaves some question as to\\nwhether any interest is payable if you stay in the rental unit less than a year. Last\\nMonth’s Rent: G.L. c. 186, §15B(2)(a).\\n20. G.L. c. 186, §15B(3)(b).\\n21. G.L. c. 186, §15B(3)(b).\\n22. G.L. c. 186, §15B(3)(b) and G.L. c. 186, §15B(7). Tanella v. Hesson, 1995 Mass. App.\\nDiv. 170 (1995).\\n23. G.L. c. 186, §15B(2)(d). Any landlord who accepts a security deposit must keep a\\nwritten record of all deposits they have received from current tenants and from former\\ntenants for two years after their tenancies end.\\n24. G.L. c. 186, §15B(2)(d).\\n25. G.L. c. 186, §15B(2)(d).\\n26. G.L. c. 186 §15B(4), (6)(e).\\n27. G.L. c. 186, § 15B(3)(a); (6)(a).\\n28. G.L. c. 186, § 15B(2)(d)(iii).\\n29. G.L. c. 186, § 15B(6).\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\n30. G.L. c. 186, §15B(4)(iii), last sentence “No deduction may be made from the security\\ndeposit for any purpose other than those set forth in this section.”\\n31. G.L. c. 186, §15B(4)(ii). Also, under G.L. c. 186, §15B(4)(i) and G.L. c. 186, §22(i),\\nafter a tenancy is terminated, a landlord who is in compliance with the water submeter\\nlaw may deduct the final unpaid water charges from the tenant’s security deposit for a\\nbilling period for which the landlord has not yet been billed.\\n32. G.L. c. 186, §15B(4)(iii).\\n33. G.L. c. 186, §15B(4)(iii).\\n34. G.L. c. 186, § 15B(2)(d)\\n35. G.L. c. 186, §15B(7). The tenant is entitled to this treble damage remedy whenever the\\nlandlord fails to comply strictly with the terms of the statute. The penalty is not\\ndiscretionary. The tenant does not need to prove that the landlord acted in bad faith or\\nthat the tenant lost money because of the landlord\\'s actions. Mellor v. Berman, 390 Mass.\\n275, 283 (1983).\\n36. G.L. c. 186, §15B(4); (6)(e).\\n37. G.L. c. 186, §15B(4). Rendall v. Tarvezian, 1984 Mass. App. Div. 13 (N. Dist.), the only\\nreported case on this subject, says that this language means what it says even if you and\\nthe landlord agree to an early termination of the lease. However, in that case, the\\nlandlord actually did not consent to early termination.\\n38. G.L. c. 186, §15B(6).\\n39. G.L. c. 186, §15B(6)(e), (7). In those cases where the landlord\\'s conduct entitles you to\\nget the deposit back while you are still living on the premises, but the landlord refuses to\\nreturn it after demand, the security deposit law is ambiguous regarding treble damages,\\nbut the Appeals Court has interpreted the statute to require such a remedy. Castenholz v.\\nCaira, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 758, 764 (1986); Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907,\\n909 (1987) (rescript). Castenholz further holds that filing a lawsuit is itself considered a\\n\"demand,\" so that a landlord who is properly sued for the return of the deposit and does\\nnot immediately tender it thereby becomes liable for treble damages. Castenholz, 21\\nMass. App. Ct. at 764. Also, if the landlord is subject to the Consumer Protection Act,\\nG.L. c. 93A, recourse can be had to its treble damage provisions. 940 C.M.R.\\n§3.17(4)(a),(b),(e), and (k). See McGrath v. Mishara, 386 Mass. 74, 82-87 (1982),\\nregarding the interplay between security deposit statute and Chapter 93A claims.\\nChapter 93A requires a demand 30 days before filing suit, except where the tenant\\'s\\nclaim is asserted by way of counterclaim against the landlord.\\n40. G.L. c. 186, § 15B(6)(e) and (7).\\n41. G.L. c. 186, § 15B(6)(a)(e) and (7).\\n42. G.L. c. 186, §15B(6)(b). This language does not prohibit the landlord from filing a\\nseparate lawsuit against the tenant to recover the damages. Jinwala v. Bizzaro, 24 Mass.\\nApp. Ct. 1, 7 (1987). A landlord cannot condition their return of part of the deposit on\\nyour agreement to release them from paying the balance. In Goes v. Feldman, 8 Mass.\\nApp. 84 (1979), a case decided under the Consumer Protection Act, a trustee who tried\\nto retain $125 by using a restrictive endorsement on a check was held liable for three\\ntimes the entire deposit, plus costs and attorney\\'s fees — a total of $3,187.80.\\n43. G.L. c. 186, §15B(4)(iii).\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\n44. G.L. c. 186, §15B(1)(e), (3)(a). The tenant is entitled to an award by the court of treble\\ndamage remedy whenever the landlord fails to comply strictly with the terms of the\\nstatute. The penalty is not discretionary. The tenant does not need to prove that the\\nlandlord acted in bad faith or that the tenant lost money because of the landlord\\'s\\nactions. Mellor v.

Hilda Hernandez,\\nHampden Housing Court, 91-SC-1865, p. 3 (March 16, 1992), where the court found\\nthat security deposit law did not insulate purchaser at foreclosure sale from liability for\\ndeposits. See also Cruz v. Cabrera, Northeast Housing Court, 92-SC-00074, p. 4 (Sept.\\n25, 1992), where court found buyer at foreclosure sale liable to tenants for the return of\\nsecurity deposit and awarded tenant treble damages, plus court costs (credited against\\nunpaid rent).\\n51. Government agencies that take over properties for back taxes may not be responsible for\\nthe amount of the security deposit. Some banks may not be responsible while in the\\nprocess of foreclosing, but may become responsible if they transfer title to themselves.\\nG.L. c. 186, § 15B(5).\\n52. G.L. c. 186, §15B(5) (last paragraph), (7A) (last paragraph). In Vinton v. Demetrion, 19\\nMass. App. Ct. 948, 949 (1985) (rescript), the court affirmed that the new landlords\\ncould be liable to the tenants for damages even though they took ownership of the\\nproperty shortly after the tenants had been evicted. The decision does not address their\\nliability for treble damages claimed by the plaintiffs.\\n53. 24 C.F.R. §982.313 (Housing Choice Voucher Program; 24 C.F.R. §983.258 (Project-\\nBased Voucher).\\n54. For the Housing Choice Voucher Program and Project-Based Voucher programs, there\\nare no HUD regulations on last month’s rent.\\n55. Previously, HUD regulations specifically did not permit charging last month’s rent for\\nthe Section 8 program, since the housing agency would reimburse the owner for any\\nvacancy loss if the tenant moved out without prior notice. Attorney General v. Brown,\\n400 Mass. 826 (1987) (issue of whether landlord unlawfully discriminated against\\nSection 8 subsidy holders because of policy of not accepting tenants where last month’s\\nrent could not be collected). These regulations were changed in 1995. If an owner\\ninsisted that a Section 8 tenant pay full contract rent as a last month\\'s rent, this would\\nlikely be in violation of G.L. c. 151B, §4(10).\\n56. See 24 C.F.R. §982.551(e) (family obligation not to commit any serious or repeated\\nviolation of lease) and 24 C.R.F. §982.552(c)(1)(i) (housing agency right to terminate\\nassistance or deny voucher for breach of family obligations).\\nChapter 3: Security Deposits\\n\\n57.

Prior to 1995, owners could pursue claims against the housing agency for a certain\\namount of vacancy loss, property damage, or unpaid rent if the tenant didn’t handle\\nthese matters properly. Back then, tenants would want to make sure to contest these\\nclaims since it would affect what they had to pay back the housing agency. HUD,\\nhowever, eliminated these provisions. In some cases, tenants still have repayment\\nagreements with housing agencies for these claims, and a Section 8 voucher participant\\ncan face termination, or be denied future assistance, if they fail to comply with such an\\nagreement. See 24 C.F.R. §982.552(c)(v-vii).\\n60. 24 C.F.R. 880.608 (Section 8 new construction program); 24 C.F.R. §881.601 (Section 8\\nsubstantial rehabilitation); 24 C.F.R. §882.414 (Section 8 moderate rehabilitation\\nprogram); 24 C.F.R. §886.315 (Section 8 property disposition); 24 C.F.R.§§891.435,\\n891.635, and 891.775 (Section 202 and Section 811 supportive housing programs).

You can be a:\\n§ Tenant with Written Lease\\n§ Tenant at Will\\n§ Tenant at Sufferance\\n§ Tenant by Regulation\\n§ Other Kinds of Non-Traditional Housing\\n1. Tenant with Written Lease\\nIf you and your landlord have a written agreement that states your rent\\nand the length of your tenancy, then you have a lease. Usually a lease is\\nfor 1 year. But it may be shorter or longer.\\n▲Chapter 4: What Kind of Tenancy Do You Have\\n\\n2. Tenant at Will\\nThere is no agreed upon date for you to move out, so you have a month-\\nto-month tenancy. Either party may end the tenancy at any time after\\ngiving the required notice. Your agreement with your landlord may be\\nwritten or oral. See the section called Who is a Tenant at Will later in\\nthis chapter.\\n3. Tenant at Sufferance\\nYour tenancy has ended because either your lease ended or the landlord\\nhas sent you a notice to quit terminating your tenancy. Your landlord has\\nnot agreed to it, but you are staying in your apartment anyway.\\n4. Tenant by Regulation\\nYou rent a mobile home or you are a tenant in public or subsidized\\nhousing. You have more protections than tenants who have a private\\nlandlord. For more information about your rights in mobile homes, see\\nChapter 16: Mobile Homes. For more about public housing go to Public\\nHousing at:\\nMassLegalHelp.org/public-housing.\\n5. Other Kinds of Non-Traditional Housing\\nIf you are in a program that provides temporary housing and services\\nwhile you look for permanent housing, you may have rights similar to a\\ntenant. For example, you may have the right to challenge an eviction in\\ncourt. This depends upon the type of program.\\nTenants with Leases\\nA lease is a written agreement between a landlord and a tenant that states the\\namount of the rent and the length of your tenancy. If you sign a one-year lease\\nfor an apartment with rent of $950 a month, you agree to pay the landlord $950\\nevery month for one year. During this year, the landlord cannot raise the rent.\\nNor can she evict you just because they may want you to move out. During this\\nyear, the landlord can evict you only if you have not paid your rent or if you\\ndon\\'t follow the terms of your lease. For example, if the lease says you cannot\\nhave pets and you get a dog without your landlord\\'s permission.\\n1. Does My Lease Have Illegal Terms\\nIf your lease is legal, it may have clauses that are not legal. Your landlord cannot\\nforce you to follow any illegal lease clauses in your lease. See Chapter 1:\\nBefore you Move In - Are There Illegal Clauses.\\nChapter 4: What Kind of Tenancy Do You Have ▲\\n\\n2. How Long Is my Lease Valid\\nA lease is for a fixed period of time—for example, 1 year. You need to know if\\nyour lease is \"self-extending\" or you have an option to renew. Usually, you can\\nfigure this out by reading the first 10 or 15 lines of the lease.\\na. Self-extending Leases\\nYou have a self-extending lease if your lease says something like:\\n. . . this lease will continue in full force and effect after the above term\\nfrom year to year until either the Lessor (landlord) or the Lessee (tenant),\\non or before the first day of the month in any year, gives to the other\\nwritten notice of intention to terminate this lease. . . .\\nThis means, you or your landlord must give the other written notice if you want\\nto terminate the tenancy. If neither you nor your landlord gives the other notice,\\nyour lease continues or \"extends\" automatically for another year. If the original\\nlease was not 1 year, it extends for the same amount of time as the original lease.\\nIf you have a self-extending lease, the terms of your original lease stay the same.\\nYou can only change them if you and your landlord agree and write it on the\\nlease. If you want to leave, pay attention to when the lease says you must give\\nyour landlord notice. Usually, leases say you must give your landlord notice at\\nleast 1 month before the lease ends.\\nb. Option to Renew\\nYou have an option to renew if your lease says something like:\\n. . . the tenant\\'s option to renew must be exercised in writing and must be\\nreceived by the landlord no less than __ days before the expiration of this\\nlease. . . .\\nThis means:\\n§ If you want to stay, you must give your landlord written notice by the\\ndate specified in the lease.\\n§ If you plan to leave at the end of the lease, you do not have to give a\\nlandlord notice.\\nRead your lease to figure out when you must give your landlord notice that you\\nwant to renew the lease. Write this on your calendar so you remember to do this.\\nIf you want to stay for another lease term, you may have to enter into a new lease\\n1\\nor sign the existing lease again. The new lease can have the same terms as the\\n▲Chapter 4: What Kind of Tenancy Do You Have\\n\\nold lease. Or you or your landlord can change certain terms. For example, your\\nlandlord may want to increase the rent. See Chapter 5: Rent.\\nIf you have an option to renew and you do not give your landlord notice in time\\nand then you decide to stay, you will become:\\n§ a tenant at will if your landlord agrees to your staying, or\\n§ a tenant at sufferance if your landlord tells you to leave.\\nTenants at Will\\nIf you do not have a lease, but you do have your landlord\\'s permission to live in\\nyour apartment, you are a tenant at will. This is the most common kind of\\ntenancy. It is also called a \"month-to-month tenancy\" because landlords usually\\nrequire tenants to pay rent once a month, in advance.\\nAs a tenant at will, you have the right to \"lawful and exclusive possession\" of the\\nplace you rent. This means your landlord can only come into your apartment\\nwith your permission or in certain situations. If they do not get your permission,\\nthey are trespassing.2 Many landlords think they can enter an apartment\\nwhenever they want because they own the property. For more information about\\nwhen a landlord can enter your apartment, see Chapter 8: Getting Repairs\\nMade: Landlord\\'s Right to Enter Your Home.\\nYou are a tenant at will if:\\n3\\n§ You have an oral agreement to rent;\\n§ You have a written agreement with your landlord that says you have a\\nmonth-to-month tenancy or it does not say when your tenancy ends. If you\\nhave a written agreement for a fixed term or it gives the date your tenancy\\nends, it is a lease.\\n§ Your written lease has ended or \"expired,\" you have not signed a new\\nlease, and your landlord continues to accept rent at the beginning of the\\nmonth without objecting or writing on your rent check \"for use and\\noccupancy only\";\\n§ Your landlord sends you a valid notice to quit that says it terminates your\\ntenancy and then later decides to allow you to stay on without a new lease;\\n§ You have a written agreement with your landlord that says that it’s a lease\\nbut does not state the date on which your tenancy ends or the amount of\\nthe rent -This is not a lease but rather a tenancy at will agreement.4 See\\nChapter 1: Before You Move In - Is My Lease Legal.\\nChapter 4: What Kind of Tenancy Do You Have ▲\\n\\n§ You have lived in a rooming house for more than three consecutive\\nmonths. For more about your rights as a rooming house tenant see\\nChapter 15: Rooming Houses.\\n§ Your written lease is not subsidized under state or federal law and the\\nlandlord lost the building in foreclosure on or after November 29, 2007.5\\nNote: A Section 8 voucher is subsidized.\\nTenants at Sufferance\\nIf you do not have your landlord\\'s permission to stay in your apartment after your\\nlease or agreement ends or after your landlord terminates your tenancy by\\nsending you a notice to quit, you are a tenant at sufferance.6\\nYou are a tenant at sufferance if:\\n§ Your written lease expires and the landlord wants you to leave.7 Your lease\\nwill expire if you do not renew it for another term or it is not self-\\nextending. See How Long is My Lease Valid.\\n§ You have a lease and your landlord sends you a valid notice to quit that\\nterminates your tenancy for not paying your rent or otherwise breaking\\nyour lease;\\n§ You were a tenant at will and your landlord sends you a valid 14-day\\nnotice to quit for non-payment of rent8 or a 30-day notice to quit for any\\nother reason; or\\n§ You are a subtenant and you are living in the apartment after the original\\ntenant\\'s lease or tenancy ended.9\\nTo figure out if a notice to quit is valid, see Chapter 12: Evictions - Receiving\\nProper Notice.\\nLike other tenants, tenants at sufferance:\\n§ Have a right to a decent place to live,\\n§ Can ask a Board of Health or a court to order the landlord to make repairs,\\n§ Have the right to \"lawful and exclusive possession,” which means a\\nlandlord can only come into your apartment with your permission (unless\\nit’s an emergency or there is a court order),\\n§ Have the right to live there until a judge orders you to move, and\\n§ Have the right to sue their landlord for negligence.10\\n▲Chapter 4: What Kind of Tenancy Do You Have\\n\\nThe biggest difference between a tenant at sufferance and other tenants is that if\\nyou are a tenant at sufferance a landlord does not have to give you a \"notice to\\nquit\" to start the eviction process. She does not need to tell you ahead of time\\nthat she is going to ask the court to evict you.\\nThis does not mean that a landlord can come into your apartment and physically\\nmove you out. If you are a tenant at sufferance, a landlord must still go to court\\nand ask the court for permission to evict you.11\\nEven though the landlord does not have to send you a notice to quit before asking\\nthe court for permission to evict you, if she goes to court, she must send you\\nnotice of the eviction hearing. You must get a Summons and Complaint. If you\\nreceive a court summons, do not ignore it. Talk to a lawyer as soon as possible,\\nand see Chapter 12: Evictions. You have a right to defend yourself in court and\\ntry to prevent the eviction or postpone it so you have time to move.\\nCan a Tenant at Sufferance Become a Tenant at Will?\\nA tenancy at sufferance can easily be converted back into a tenancy at will. You\\nand your landlord only need to agree to the arrangement. You can agree in\\nwriting, orally, or by your landlord\\'s accepting rent without \"reserving their\\nrights.\" For example, if you pay rent at the beginning of the month and your\\nlandlord accepts it and does not say they reserve their right to have you leave the\\napartment, you become a tenant at will. If they want to keep you as a tenant at\\nsufferance, they must reserve their rights and should give you a receipt for rent\\npaid stating \"for use and occupancy only.\" If a landlord does not do this, you\\nmay become a tenant at will.12\\nTenancy by Regulation\\nIf you are a tenant in a mobile home or public or subsidized housing, you are a\\ntenant by regulation.13 You may have more protections as a tenant.\\nIf you live in a mobile home, see Chapter 16: Mobile Homes.\\nIf you live in public or subsidized housing, go to:\\n§ Public Housing at www.MassLegalHelp.org/housing/public-housing.\\n§ Housing Programs in Massachusetts at\\nwww.masslegalhelp.org/housing/housing-programs\\nChapter 4: What Kind of Tenancy Do You Have ▲\\n\\nOther Types of Non-Traditional Housing\\nIf you are in a program that provides you with temporary housing and services\\nwhile you look for permanent housing, you may have some rights similar to a\\ntenant. For example, Massachusetts courts have established that people with\\ncertain government housing subsidies who live in transitional housing that also\\nprovide various services to assist people with securing permanent housing have\\nthe right to protection from unfair evictions. Just like any landlord, a landlord of\\nsuch a transitional housing facility must use the court\\'s eviction process to evict a\\ntenant.14\\nHowever, people who live in other types of transitional housing, such as those\\nwho reside in Emergency Assistance shelters, are not entitled to defend an\\neviction in court. For more information about your rights if you are in an\\nEmergency Assistance shelter go to: www.masslegalhelp.org/homelessness\\nFor more information about your rights if you live in a rooming house or\\nDepartment of Mental Health Residential Housing, go to Chapter 15: Rooming\\nHouses.\\n▲Chapter 4: What Kind of Tenancy Do You Have\\n\\nEndnotes\\n1.

It also explains tenants’ rights and ways to deal with\\nthese problems.\\nWhat Is Rent?\\nRent is the amount you agree to pay in exchange for your landlord’s promise to\\nprovide a safe and decent place for you to live.1 The rent you and your landlord\\nagree on is the rent for an apartment that is in good condition.2\\nThe law defines what is safe and decent in the state codes, including the State\\nSanitary Code.3 You and a landlord cannot bargain the Sanitary Code away.4\\nThis means it is illegal for a landlord to say that your rent is already “discounted”\\nor “below market” because of unsafe or unrepaired conditions in your\\napartment.5 Your landlord is legally responsible for keeping your apartment in\\ngood condition.6 This is true for all tenants. For more see Chapter 8: Getting\\nRepairs Made - Your Right to a Decent Place to Live and the Housing Code\\nChecklist (Booklet 2).\\n1. How Much Rent Can a Landlord Charge\\nMost landlords can demand whatever rent the private market will allow, not what\\nyou can afford.7 There is currently no legal limit to the amount of rent a landlord\\ncan charge in the private unsubsidized housing market in Massachusetts.8\\nIn private subsidized housing, public housing, or in a mobile home park covered\\nby a local rent control law, the rent a landlord can charge is controlled, and there\\nare procedures for increasing the amount. For more about:\\n▪ Public Housing\\nSee the booklet Rent in Public Housing at\\nwww.MassLegalHelp.org/housing/tenants-rights-in-public-housing\\n▪ Subsidized Housing\\nSee Housing Programs in Legal Tactics: Finding Public & Subsidized\\nHousing at www.MassLegalHelp.org/housing/finding-housing-booklets\\n▪ Mobile Homes\\nSee Chapter 16: Mobile Homes.\\n▲ Chapter 5: Rent\\n\\n2. Keep Rent Receipts\\nIt is important to keep a good record of your rent payments. If there is ever a\\nproblem and your landlord claims that you did not pay, you will need proof that\\nyou paid. Here is how to keep good records:\\n▪ Never give your landlord cash for rent unless you can get a receipt.\\n▪ Get receipts for all rent payments. The receipt should state the month and\\nyear for which rent was paid.\\n▪ Ask the landlord for a receipt or make your own receipt for your landlord\\nto sign. Use this sample Rent Receipt (Form 2).\\n▪ Pay your rent with a check or money order and write on the front of the\\ncheck or money order the month and year for which rent is paid. Make a\\ncopy of the check or money order, including any receipt stub.\\n▪ Keep proof of all rent payments in a safe place. Save all rent receipts,\\ncancelled checks, and copies of money orders with their stubs in a special\\nfolder or envelope. If you pay rent via an online portal, take screenshots of\\nyour monthly payments and save those.\\n▪ For multiple tenants contributing to rent, each should have their own proof\\nof rent paid. The best way is for each tenant to pay their part of the rent\\ndirectly to the landlord and keep proof of their payment. If there is a\\ndisagreement later about whether the landlord gave someone permission to\\nbe a tenant, each tenant will want proof that they paid rent, and that the\\nlandlord accepted their rent.\\nPaying Rent\\n1. What If the Rent Is Late\\nAs a tenant, you are obligated to pay only the rent you and your landlord have\\nagreed upon. You must pay the rent in advance, on or before the date you and the\\nlandlord agreed rent is due. Often the agreed rent date is the first of the month.\\nIf you are late paying the rent, a landlord may try to charge you a late fee or\\npenalty. It is against the law for landlords to charge late fees in some cases. See\\nbelow in Late Fees.9\\nA landlord may also try to evict you for repeated late payments or for non-\\npayment of rent. Most landlords do not send eviction notices if once in a while\\ntenants are several days late with the rent. Even if a landlord sends an eviction\\nnotice, you may be able to stop the eviction by paying the rent you owe. See\\nbelow in Stopping an Eviction for Non-Payment or Late Payment.”\\nChapter 5: Rent ▲\\n\\na. Late Fees\\nYour landlord cannot charge you interest or fees on late rent payments unless\\nyour lease or written rental agreement says the landlord can charge late fees in\\nwhat is called a “late payment penalty clause.”10\\nIf you have a written lease or tenancy-at-will agreement, check to see whether it\\nhas such a late payment penalty clause. If you do not have a written lease or\\nrental agreement, or there is no late payment penalty clause, you do not have to\\npay a late fee, even if your rent is late.\\nEven if your written agreement has a late payment penalty clause, a landlord\\ncannot collect any late payment fee until you are 30 days late with the rent.11 If\\nthe late payment penalty clause says that the landlord can collect a late fee before\\n30 days pass, the clause is illegal, and you should not pay a late fee.12\\n▪ For late fees in public housing, see the booklet Rent in Public Housing,\\navailable online at: www.MassLegalHelp.org/housing/tenants-rights-in-\\npublic-housing\\nb. “Discounts” for Paying on Time\\nIf you have a lease, a landlord may try to collect a late fee through what is called\\na \"discount clause.\" A discount clause says your agreed rent is a “discount rent”\\nfor when you pay rent on time, and you have to pay an extra amount if you are\\nlate. A discount clause is a late payment penalty clause in disguise, and it is\\nillegal in Massachusetts.13 If your lease has a discount clause, you do not have to\\npay the extra amount, even if your rent payment is late. Pay only the rent you\\nagreed to pay. If your landlord demands extra money based on a discount clause,\\ntell your landlord (in writing) that the discount clause is illegal.\\n▪ For more information about late penalty and discount clauses, see\\nChapter 1: Before Moving In - Common Lease Clauses.\\n2. Disputes about the Amount of Rent\\nIf your landlord incorrectly calculated your rent, did not credit you for rent you\\npaid, or charged you fees or damages that are not your responsibility to pay,\\nthere are steps to take to try to protect yourself.\\na. Payment and Acceptance\\nOne way to resolve a dispute about rent is to pay your landlord what you think is\\nowed with a check that has this statement on the back of the check:\\n\"Endorsing or cashing this check constitutes\\nfull payment of rent due up to and including\\nfor the month of __, year __.\"\\n▲ Chapter 5: Rent\\n\\nYou may also include with your check a letter that explains why you do not owe\\nthe amount the landlord claims you owe.\\nIn most cases, if your landlord cashes the check with this statement on the back\\nwithout any objection, they have agreed to accept your payment as full\\npayment.14\\nIf your landlord takes your rent check but also writes on it that they are not\\naccepting it as full payment for all rent owed, you still may be able to argue that\\nthey have accepted the check as full payment.15\\nb. Protect Yourself\\nIf your landlord still disagrees about the amount of rent you owe after accepting\\nand cashing your check with this statement on the back, you should put the\\ndisputed amount in a bank account that is separate from your other money. By\\nsetting aside the money in dispute, you will be more credible to the judge if your\\nlandlord takes you to court.\\nAlways protect yourself by keeping in a safe place a copy of:\\n▪ The front and back of your check with your statement that you are paying\\nthe full amount of rent.\\n▪ The cancelled check after the landlord cashes it, and\\n▪ Any letter you send the landlord.\\n3. Stopping an Eviction for Non-Payment or Late\\nPayment\\na. Always Try to Cure\\nYou have a right to stop your landlord from bringing an eviction by paying all\\nthe rent you owe by certain deadlines. This is called “curing” the non-payment.\\nA landlord must accept the rent if you try to cure before the certain deadlines.16\\nDeadlines to cure are different for tenants with leases and with no leases.\\nb. You Have No Lease\\nIf you do not have a lease and your landlord gives you a 14-day notice to quit for\\nnon-payment of rent, you have the right to stop your landlord from bringing an\\neviction by curing and paying all the rent you owe within 10 days of receiving\\nthe notice to quit.17 The only time that you do not have a right to cure is if you\\nhave already received another 14-day notice to quit for non-payment of rent\\nwithin the previous 12 months.18\\nChapter 5: Rent ▲\\n\\nIf you do not have a lease, your 14-day notice to quit for non-payment must have\\nthe following sentence about your right to cure:\\n\\'\\'If you have not received a notice to quit for nonpayment of rent within\\nthe last twelve months, you have a right to prevent termination of your\\ntenancy by paying your landlord or your landlord\\'s attorney or the\\nperson to whom you customarily pay your rent the full amount of rent due\\nwithin ten days after your receipt of this notice.\\'\\'19\\nIf your 14-day notice to quit is missing this language, and your landlord files an\\neviction case, your deadline to cure is extended to the date your Answer to the\\nlandlord’s court papers are due (Answer date). In this situation, if you cure by the\\nAnswer date, you can ask the court to have the eviction case dismissed. The\\nAnswer date is on the Summons and Complaint served on you by your landlord.\\nThe Answer is usually due three business days before your first event in court.\\nFor more about the answer date, see Chapter 12: Evictions - Important Dates.\\nc. You Have a Lease\\nIf you have a lease and your landlord gives you a 14-day notice to quit for non-\\npayment of rent, you have the right to stop an eviction by curing and paying all\\nthe rent you owe on or before the Answer date that is listed on the court papers\\n(the Summons and Complaint).20 If you cure by the Answer date, you can ask the\\ncourt to have the eviction case dismissed.\\nIf you have a lease and cure before the expiration of your tenancy by the 14-\\nday Notice to Quit, your landlord is not allowed to bring an eviction case against\\nyou at all, even if this is not the first time you have cured a non-payment within\\nthe previous 12 months.21\\nIf you wait until after your landlord starts an eviction case to cure, you can still\\nask the court to have the eviction case dismissed, but it becomes more expensive.\\nYou must then pay not only the rent owed, but also the landlord\\'s costs for filing\\nthe eviction case and interest on the rent owed.22\\nIt is illegal for a lease to say that you have given up (waived) your right to cure.23\\nd. Landlord Refuses Payment\\nIf your landlord refuses to let you cure by accepting your payment, be sure to\\ndocument the refusal. If you hand deliver your payment, have someone come\\nwith you who can witness whether the landlord refuses to accept it.\\nIf your landlord refuses to accept payment, send them a letter that you offered to\\npay and the date and amount you tried to pay. Have your statement signed by a\\nwitness who knows of your attempt to cure. Keep a copy of the letter for\\nyourself.\\n▲ Chapter 5: Rent\\n\\nEven if you miss the deadline to cure the non-payment, try to convince your\\nlandlord to accept your rent and stop any eviction action. Often, landlords agree\\nnot to go ahead with an eviction case because their real interest is in receiving the\\nrent.\\nImportant: If your landlord refuses to accept your rent, it is very\\nimportant that you set aside all the rent that becomes due each month in a\\nbank account that is separate from your other money. Having the rent set\\naside in a separate account will increase your credibility in court. It will\\nalso help you because if you pay what is owed the landlord within 10\\ndays of any judgment against, you can keep your tenancy.\\ne. Eviction for Repeated Late Payment\\nIf you pay rent late often, your landlord may try to evict you because of repeated\\nor chronic late payment, instead of non-payment of rent. Late payment of rent is\\nnot the same as non-payment of rent.24 For late payment of rent, a landlord\\ncannot use a 14-day Notice to quit but in most cases, must use a 30-day (or rental\\nperiod) Notice to Quit. However, if you have a lease, the lease may allow the\\nlandlord to send you a Notice to Quit that is shorter than 30 days for any reason\\nother than non-payment of rent.25 Read your lease to figure this out.\\nf. Delay in Government Assistance Payment and Other Good\\nReasons\\nIf the late payment or non-payment of rent is caused by a delay in your receipt of\\ngovernment assistance or rental payments and you are facing an eviction, you\\nhave the right to a 7-day continuance (postponement) of an eviction action.26\\nYour landlord cannot proceed with the eviction case if you are able to pay all\\nrent due with interest and costs of the court case before the continued court date.27\\nAlso, if you or someone in your household has a disability, you may be entitled\\nto a reasonable accommodation to prevent eviction. For example, if you get your\\ndisability SSI income on the 3rd of the month, you should ask the landlord and\\nthe judge for a reasonable accommodation of a later due date for your rent. If\\nyou have a disability that makes it hard to pay rent on time, you may ask for a\\nreasonable accommodation for example, by arranging for a representative payee\\nto pay your rent for you.\\n▪ For more on reasonable accommodations, see Chapter 7: Discrimination\\n- Discrimination Based on Disability.\\nIf there are other good reasons for a late- or non-payment, you should explain the\\nreasons to the landlord and the judge. Temporary money problems or other good\\nreasons might help you make a plan with the landlord to pay by a reasonable\\ntime and to avoid eviction.\\n▪ For more about your rights in an eviction case, see Chapter 12:\\nEvictions.\\nChapter 5: Rent ▲\\n\\n4. Paying Rent to a Condo Association\\nIf you rent a condominium, you pay rent to the owner of the condo, who is your\\nlandlord. The owner must pay a monthly condo fee to the building\\'s condo\\nassociation. If the owner stops paying the fee, or if they refuse to pay other condo\\ncharges called “assessments,” the condo association can ask you to pay your rent\\nto them instead of to your landlord.28 The condo association cannot ask you to\\npay more than your agreed rent.29\\nBefore the condo association can collect rent from you, it must wait until your\\nlandlord\\'s condo fee payments are at least 25 days late. The condo association\\nmust then send a notice to the owner saying it will collect the rent. If the owner\\ndoes not answer the notice within 10 days, or if they admit that they owe the\\nassociation money, then the association can collect all or some of your rent each\\nmonth until the fees are paid off. If the owner answers in 10 days and says they\\ndo not owe money, the condo association cannot collect any rent from you.\\nIf a condo association asks for your rent, you should ask the association to put\\nthe request in writing. You should also ask for copies of the notice it sent to the\\nowner and any written response from the owner. Remember, the condo\\nassociation cannot ask you to pay more than your rent.\\nAn owner cannot retaliate against you, including trying to evict you, for paying\\nrent to a condo association as allowed by law.30 To protect yourself, be sure to get\\nreceipts for any rent payments that you make to a condo association.\\nRent Increases\\nOne of the most common problems tenants face is unfair and unaffordable rent\\nincreases. Sometimes, the reason for the increase may be illegal. Sometimes, the\\nrent increase notice may be defective or wrong. Often, a large rent increase\\nimpacts a whole building of tenants who face being displaced because of\\nunaffordable rents.\\nIn all cases, whether a rent increase is legal or illegal, proper or defective, or\\naffordable or unaffordable, a landlord cannot increase your rent without your\\nagreement to pay the increase.31 Without your agreement, a rent increase notice is\\nsimply a one-sided demand from your landlord. In short, there can be no legally\\nenforceable rent increase unless both you and your landlord agree to the\\nincrease.\\nIf you do not agree to a rent increase, you still have to pay the current rent (the\\nrent that you did agree to pay). If you continue to pay the current rent, your\\nlandlord cannot evict you for non-payment of rent because you are paying the\\nrent you agreed to pay, and just not paying the rent increase you didn’t agree to\\npay. Refusing to pay a higher rent is not considered non-payment of rent.\\n▲ Chapter 5: Rent\\n\\nIf you do not have a lease and are a tenant-at-will, a landlord can end or\\nterminate your tenancy at the existing rent with a 30-day Notice to Quit.\\nSometimes landlords send a Notice to Quit and a notice of rent increase at the\\nsame time or they combine the two notices in a single document. If you still do\\nnot agree to the higher rent after getting both notices, the landlord can then\\nproceed with what is called a “no fault” eviction case.\\nIf you have a lease, a landlord cannot demand a rent increase before your lease\\nends, except if your lease has what is called a “tax escalator clause.”32 For more\\nsee section below on Tax Escalator Clause.\\nImportant: If you do pay a rent increase, your payment can be treated as\\n“accepting” your landlord’s “offer” of a new tenancy at a higher rent—even\\nif you did not mean to agree to a permanent rent increase. If later you cannot\\ncontinue to pay the higher rent, your landlord can now evict you with a 14-day\\nNotice to Quit for non-payment of the higher rent. Before you pay any rent\\nincrease, think through your options by reading below on Options If You\\nReceive a Rent Increase.\\nIllegal Retaliatory Rent Increases\\nIn Massachusetts, it is illegal for a landlord to increase your rent in retaliation for\\nexercising your rights as a tenant to:\\n▪ Report violations of the state Sanitary Code or other housing laws,\\nwhether to the landlord, anyone who works for the landlord, or a housing\\ninspector;\\n▪ Attend, join or organize a tenants’ group;\\n▪ File a lawsuit against your landlord or defend yourself in an eviction case;\\n▪ File a discrimination complaint against your landlord with a government\\nagency; or\\n▪ Pay some of your rent to a local utility company after your landlord\\nstopped paying utility bills that were the landlord’s responsibility.33\\nIf your landlord increases your rent within 6 months of you doing any of the\\nthings listed above, the law “presumes” that your landlord is retaliating against\\nyou.\\nIf you believe that your landlord is raising your rent in retaliation for any of\\nthese actions, you can refuse to pay the increase. If the landlord tries to evict you\\nfor non-payment of rent, they must prove that they were not retaliating against\\nyou.34 If a court finds that they were retaliating, you will be allowed to stay in\\nChapter 5: Rent ▲\\n\\nyour apartment and a court can award you up to 3 months’ rent (or your actual\\ndamages, whichever is more), plus the cost of your attorney’s fees.\\nIf more than 6 months passed before your landlord increased your rent, you still\\nhave the chance to prove that the landlord’s act was retaliatory, but the burden\\nwould be on you to prove retaliation. For more information about retaliation, see\\nChapter 12: Evictions and Chapter 13: When to Take Your Landlord to\\nCourt.\\nDocument Why the Rent Increase Is Illegal\\nIf you believe that your landlord has illegally raised your rent, and you want to\\nstay in your apartment, the best thing to do is to collect all proof that will help\\nshow that the increase is illegal. For example, if you feel that the landlord has\\nretaliated against you for reporting or complaining about bad conditions, make\\nsure to get a certified copy of all housing inspection reports, each signed by the\\ninspector who did the inspection. Also keep copies of any letters, emails or texts\\nthat you sent the landlord about the problems. With such documents and\\ninformation, you will be better prepared to protect yourself if your landlord takes\\nyou to court.\\n1. New Owners\\nYou do not automatically have to pay a rent increase or move out just because\\nyour building has a new owner.35 In most situations, whether you are a month-to-\\nmonth tenant at will or you have a lease, the new owner has to “step into the\\nshoes” of the old landlord. This means your new landlord has to accept your\\ncurrent rent until your lease or tenancy agreement ends.\\nIf you are a tenant at will, the new owner has to give you a valid notice of a rent\\nincrease and you have to accept that increase. If you reject a valid notice of rent\\nincrease, the new landlord’s option is to terminate your tenancy and bring an\\neviction case against you, where you can raise legal defenses as well as claims\\nthat you may have against the landlord. For more on valid notices of rent\\nincrease and termination of tenancy, see Proper Notice of Rent Increase section\\nbelow.\\nWhether you are a tenant at will or tenant with a lease, the new landlord\\nbecomes responsible for your last month’s rent and the security deposit you paid\\nto your former landlord.36 This is true even if it is your former landlord who did\\nnot transfer your last month’s rent and/or security deposit to the new owner.\\nA new owner—especially a corporate investor—may want to clear out a building\\nof all occupants in order to renovate and re-rent it at much higher rents, or to sell\\nthe building as condos. In these situations, tenants have organized and negotiated\\nagreements for fair rents. For more about these and other options see section\\nbelow on Options If You Receive a Rent Increase Notice.\\n▲ Chapter 5: Rent\\n\\n2. Condominium Conversion\\nIf you think that your landlord may be converting your building to\\ncondominiums (“condos”), or if you have received a notice that your apartment\\nis being turned into a condo, you have important legal rights, including the right\\nto stay and limits on how much your rent can increase.37\\nFor example, whether you have a lease or not, it is illegal for your landlord or a\\nnew owner of the condo to increase your rent above a certain amount. Under the\\nlaw, a landlord or condo owner cannot increase your rent by more than 10% per\\nyear or above the increase in the Consumer Price Index the year before your\\nlandlord gave you notice of the condo conversion, whichever is less.38\\nAlso, if you have a lease, your landlord cannot change your rent until the lease\\nends. The one time when a landlord can increase your rent is if your lease has\\nwhat is called a “tax escalator clause.” This clause allows a rent increase during\\nthe lease if the property tax goes up.39 For more see section below on Tax\\nEscalator Clause.\\nIn some cases, a landlord may illegally attempt to get around the condo\\nconversion tenant protections by demanding a very high rent increase before\\nfiling a master deed for the condo. But under the law, the owner has only to have\\nan \"intent to convert\" for tenants to be protected against rent increases.40 For\\nmore about condos and tenant protections see Chapter 17: Condominium\\nControl.\\n3. After Foreclosure\\nIf you think your rental unit may be foreclosed, you will want to become familiar\\nwith important legal rights that are different from other tenancy related rights.\\nFor example, if you have a Section 8 or other subsidy, you can stay in your unit\\nand pay the same amount of rent after a foreclosure.41 To find out more about\\nwhat to in terms of paying rent and what your rights and options are during each\\npart of the foreclosure process, see Chapter 18: Tenants and Foreclosure.\\n4. Tax Escalator Clause\\nIf you have a lease, the only way that a landlord can raise your rent before the\\nlease ends is through what is called a \"tax escalator clause.\" A tax escalator\\nclause in a lease allows your landlord to pass on to you any increase in your\\nlandlord\\'s property taxes by increasing your rent before the lease term ends.42\\nIf your landlord demands an extra payment from you under a tax escalator\\nclause, you should: 1) read your lease to see whether the clause is legal, and\\n2) make sure the landlord is not overcharging you.\\nChapter 5: Rent ▲\\n\\na. Is the Clause Legal\\nThe law requires that tax escalator clauses be written in a certain way.43 If the tax\\nescalator clause in your lease does not contain all three parts below, the clause is\\nillegal, and your landlord cannot use an invalid tax escalator clause to increase\\nyour rent.44 Read the text of your lease carefully. The language of a tax escalator\\nclause must contain the following three things:\\n▪ A statement that you are obligated to pay only that exact percentage of any\\nproperty tax increase that is assessed to your apartment.\\n▪ The exact percentage of any property tax increase that is your obligation to\\npay. For example, if you live in a three unit building and the units are all\\nthe same size, you would be obligated to pay 1/3rd of the tax increase for\\nthe whole building.\\n▪ A statement that if your landlord gets a property tax refund (“abatement”),\\nyou will receive a proportionate share of that reduction (less any lawyer\\'s\\nfees that the landlord paid in getting the reduction). For example, if the\\ncity sends your landlord a tax abatement, you would be entitled to a\\nproportionate reduction in rent.45\\nb. Is the Landlord Overcharging You\\nEven if the tax escalator clause is legal, you need to make sure that your landlord\\nis not overcharging you. Go to your local tax assessor\\'s office and ask there\\nwhether taxes on the property you rent have gone up and also whether your\\nlandlord got a tax abatement. Abatements are reductions in taxes that property\\nowners get after the tax assessor determines that the original tax assessment was\\ntoo high.\\nIf the taxes have gone up, you will need to find out by how much to figure out\\nwhether your landlord calculated your proportionate rent increase correctly. If\\nyour landlord has received a tax abatement, you will need to figure out how\\nmuch the landlord owes you.\\nProper Notice of Rent Increase\\nTo legally raise your rent, your landlord first must give you valid notice of the\\nrent increase demand. The type of tenancy you have will determine when a\\nlandlord must send a notice of rent increase, and whether this notice is likely to\\nbe joined with a Notice to Quit. To figure out what type of tenancy you have, see\\nChapter 4: What Kind of Tenancy Do You Have.\\n▲ Chapter 5: Rent\\n\\n1. Tenants with Leases\\nIf you have a lease, the landlord can seek a rent increase only based on the terms\\nof the lease. For example, your lease may prohibit a rent increase or it may allow\\na rent increase (but only under certain conditions). Also depending upon what\\ntype of lease you have, a landlord may only be able to seek a rent increase at\\ncertain times.\\na. No Increases during the Lease\\nYour landlord typically cannot increase your rent during the term of your lease.\\nThe one time when a landlord can increase your rent during the lease is if your\\nlease has a “tax escalator clause.” This clause allows a rent increase during the\\nlease if the property tax goes up.46 For more see Tax Escalator Clause.\\nEven if you and your landlord agreed to an increase during the lease period, a\\njudge may not find the agreement valid if you received nothing in exchange for\\nthe higher rent.47\\nb. What Kind of Lease Do You Have\\nMake sure you know whether you have a self-extending lease or an option to\\nrenew lease.\\n▪ Self-Extending\\nWith a self-extending lease, if you or your landlord do nothing, the\\nlease automatically continues. You must give the landlord written notice\\nif you want to leave, or the landlord must give you a timely Notice to Quit\\nif they want you to leave. If you have a self-extending lease, and your\\nlandlord wants to increase the rent, they must send you a proper notice of\\nrent increase before the date your lease automatically extends. If the\\nlandlord sends the notice of rent increase after the lease automatically\\nextends, there can be no rent increase until the next time the lease ends.\\n(Sometimes a landlord gives a notice to quit with a notice of rent increase\\nso that if a tenant does not accept the rent increase, the lease will not\\nautomatically extend and the tenancy will end).\\n▪ Option to Renew\\nWith an option to renew lease, if you do nothing, the lease will end. An\\noption to renew is not automatic. You must renew, if you want to stay.\\nRead your lease to be clear about exactly how and by when you must give\\nthe landlord notice that you want to renew.\\nAlso read the lease to see if your landlord can increase the rent if you\\nrenew. If your lease requires your landlord to give you notice of a rent\\nincrease and the landlord does not give you notice before the lease is\\nrenewed, your rent cannot be increased during the renewed lease period.\\nChapter 5: Rent ▲\\n\\nIf your lease already says what the new rent will be if you renew, your\\nlandlord may not have to give you a separate notice of rent increase.\\nTo determine whether your lease is self-extending or whether you have an option\\nto renew see Chapter 4: What Kind of Tenancy Do You Have - How Long Is\\nMy Lease Valid.\\n2. Tenants at Will\\na. Getting Legal Notice\\nIf you are a tenant at will and do not have a lease or live in public or subsidized\\nhousing, your landlord can propose a rent increase any time. For all tenants who\\ndo not have a lease, a legally valid rent increase notice has to do two things:\\n1. End (or terminate your existing tenancy at the current rent, and\\n2. Offer you a new tenancy at a higher rent.\\nLandlords often combine the notice of rent increase and a 30-day notice to quit\\nso that if you refuse to pay the rent increase, they do not have to wait to bring an\\neviction case in court. The notice to quit and notice of rent increase can be\\ngiven as two separate documents, or as a single document combining both\\nnotices. In any case, you must receive timely notice that your landlord is\\nterminating your tenancy at the current rent and offering you a new tenancy at a\\nhigher rent. You must receive the notice terminating your current tenancy at least\\n30 days or one full rental period (if it is longer than 30 days) before the proposed\\ndate of the rent increase.48 A notice of a rent increase by itself cannot and does\\nnot end your existing tenancy at the current rent.49\\nFor example, if you pay rent on the 1st of the month and your landlord wants a\\nrent increase as of September 1, they must make sure you actually receive the\\noffer of a new tenancy at the higher rent and a notice terminating your existing\\ntenancy before August 1. If you decide to accept the rent increase but do not\\nreceive the notice of termination of tenancy until after August 1, your tenancy at\\nthe existing rent continues to the end of September, and you do not have to pay\\nthe increase until October 1. But you must continue to pay the current rent.\\nRemember: It is the date you actually receive the Notice to Quit that matters, not\\nthe date written on the Notice to Quit or the date the notice was mailed or served.\\nBe sure to write down or put in your calendar when you got the notice.\\nb. What If You Refuse to Pay the Increase\\nIf you do not accept your landlord’s rent increase demand, you still need to pay\\nthe current rent. Make sure you get receipts of the payments so that you can\\nprove that you paid the current rent. See Keep Receipts.\\n▲ Chapter 5: Rent\\n\\nIf you continue to pay the current rent, a landlord cannot send you a 14-day\\nNotice to Quit for non-payment, but must send a 30-day Notice to Quit if they\\nwant to evict you. Often, landlords do not understand this difference and try to\\nevict tenants improperly after giving a 14-day Notice to Quit for non-payment of\\nthe rent increase. If your landlord makes this mistake and files an eviction case,\\nyou should ask the court to dismiss the case because the notice to quit is\\ndefective.\\nIMPORTANT: A Notice to Quit or notice of a rent increase does not\\nmean you have to move out of your apartment, even if you choose not\\nto pay the rent increase. A Notice to Quit is the first document your\\nlandlord must give you before they can start a court eviction process. A\\nlandlord must always go through the court eviction process; they cannot\\nsimply lock you out of your home. For more about the eviction process,\\nsee Chapter 12: Evictions.\\n3. Tenants in Subsidized and Public Housing\\nIf you have a housing subsidy, the landlord may be able to seek a rent increase\\nbut must follow the rules of the housing subsidy program. This includes the\\nSection 8 voucher program and other housing programs for private landlords.\\nTo figure out what rules apply, first figure out what kind of subsidized housing\\nyou have.\\n▪ See Housing Programs in Legal Tactics: Finding Public & Subsidized\\nHousing, at: www.MassLegalHelp.org/housing/finding-housing-\\nbookletsFor information about rent increases in public housing, see the\\nbooklet Rent in Public Housing, at: www.masslegalhelp.org/rents-public.\\nOptions If You Receive a Rent Increase\\nNotice\\nIf you receive a notice of rent increase, you have three options. You can:\\n▪ Negotiate,\\n▪ Pay and stay, or\\n▪ Refuse and move.\\n1. Negotiate\\nIf you feel that the landlord\\'s proposed rent increase is unreasonable or illegal\\nand you want to keep your apartment, there are some ways you may be able to\\nchallenge or negotiate the proposed rent increase.\\nChapter 5: Rent ▲\\n\\na. Make a Counter Offer\\nWhile landlords are not legally required to negotiate with tenants, you may be\\nable to convince your landlord to reconsider. Or you may want to ask for a lower\\nincrease and make a counter offer. If you have a good relationship with the\\nlandlord, they may want to keep you as a tenant. Or ask the landlord to\\nreconsider the increase because repairs are needed, or hold off on the increase at\\nleast until the repairs are made.\\nb. Join with Other Tenants to Fight the Increase\\nTenants in buildings facing rent increases have successfully worked together to\\nnegotiate agreements with their landlords that keep rents affordable and get\\nrepairs made.\\nAs a tenant, you have important legal rights and you can have a stronger position\\nby joining with other people in your building or other tenants who have the same\\nlandlord and are facing similar problems. If you think you are facing a rent\\nincrease as part of your landlord’s plan to empty your building, the best way to\\nprotect yourself and other tenants may be by starting or joining a tenant group.\\nRemember – it is illegal for a landlord to retaliate against you for starting or\\njoining a tenant group.\\nAs part of a tenant group, you can learn together about your legal rights and\\norganizing strategies, research who really owns and controls your building, get\\nsupport from tenant advocacy organizations and elected officials, and use your\\ncollective power to negotiate with the landlord for fair rents and better\\nconditions.\\n▪ For more about how to challenge unfair rent increases, see Chapter 10:\\nGetting Organized - Unfair Rent Increases and Displacement.\\n▪ For a sample collective bargaining agreement and other sample organizing\\nforms see Forms 21-25.\\n▪ For more organizing support call a Tenant Organizing and Advocacy\\nGroup listed in the Directory.\\nc. Recent Examples of Successful Tenant Collective Bargaining\\nTenant groups in Massachusetts are successfully persuading landlords to\\nreconsider steep rent increases, building clear-outs and condominium\\nconversions by negotiating “collective bargaining agreements.” Here are some\\nexamples.\\nSame Corporate Landlord in Different Communities\\nIn 2014-2015, a diverse group of tenants in separate buildings in Chelsea,\\nDorchester, East Boston, Mattapan, Roxbury, and South Boston learned that their\\n▲ Chapter 5: Rent\\n\\nproperties were owned by the same real estate investment corporation. Each\\nproperty had between 3-10 units and had been bought under different corporate\\nnames. After the change in ownership, all of the tenants were hit with\\nunaffordable rent increases and eviction notices. The tenants joined City Life\\nVida Urbana and the Chinese Progressive Association (two bilingual tenant\\nrights organizations) and learned that although their buildings were each bought\\nunder different corporate names, they were all managed by one management\\ncompany and funded and controlled by the same few investors.\\nWith support from City Life Vida Urbana and Chinese Progressive Association,\\nthe tenants organized and launched an intensive publicity campaign, highlighting\\nthe management company’s unfair business practices and the mass displacement\\ntheir practices were causing, which was mostly hurting families of color. Facing\\nsustained pressure from the tenant associations, litigation costs in eviction cases\\ndefended by legal services, and mounting community resistance against their\\nproperty development proposals, the real estate investment group agreed to\\nnegotiate.\\nPublic officials stepped up to help with negotiations. Represented by Greater\\nBoston Legal Services attorneys, the two tenant groups successfully negotiated\\nagreements with fair rents, fair treatment, repairs, and long term leases including:\\n▪ All tenants being evicted for a reason that was not their fault would get 4-\\nyear leases starting at their existing rents, with a 3% cap on each yearly\\nrent increase; and\\n▪ All (hundreds) of the management company’s Section 8 voucher tenants\\nwould have rents with utility allowances that did not exceed 30% of the\\ntenants’ adjusted income.\\nSmall Tenant Groups\\nIn 2014, four households in a single building in Mattapan joined City Life Vida\\nUrbana after being hit with steep rent increases and eviction notices. The tenants\\norganized into a small tenant association, and with the on-going support of City\\nLife Vida Urbana, the association generated political pressure and publicity\\nabout their situation. With legal representation by the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau,\\nthe tenant association successfully negotiated housing solutions that met the\\ndifferent needs of each household including:\\n▪ For three households, a 3-5-year lease, depending on the household’s\\ninitial affordable rent, with a 5% cap on any yearly rent increases.\\n▪ For one household that needed to relocate, a 1.5 year occupancy\\nagreement with no rent increase.\\nFor more about how to challenge unfair rent increases, see Chapter 10: Getting\\nOrganized - Unfair Rent Increases and Displacement.\\nChapter 5: Rent ▲\\n\\n2. Pay and Stay\\nAnother option is that you can decide to accept the landlord’s rent increase\\ndemand and stay. Before you make this decision:\\n▪ Make sure that the landlord’s rent increase notice was proper. See Proper\\nNotice of Rent Increase. If the notice was improper and the landlord tries\\nto evict you in court, you can ask the judge to dismiss the case based on\\nthe improper notice.\\n▪ Make sure you can afford the increase because once you pay the higher\\namount that will be your new agreed-upon rent.\\n▪ If you agree to pay, consider asking for a minimum one-year lease to lock\\nin the rent so you are not hit with another rent increase demand in the near\\nfuture.\\na. Make Sure You Can Afford the Increase\\nIt can be tempting to deal with the immediate stress of a rent increase notice and\\nthe pressure of a possible eviction by paying the rent increase that your landlord\\ndemands. However, consider whether you can really afford to pay the higher\\nrent going forward.\\nIf you pay the increase even once, you will have “accepted” your landlord’s\\n“offer” of a higher rent, and you will be obligated to pay this amount as the new\\nrent going forward. If you later fail to pay the higher rent because it becomes\\nunaffordable, the landlord can then seek to evict you for non-payment of rent\\nbased on a 14-day Notice to Quit.50 If you had rejected the rent increase and\\ncontinued to pay just your old rent amount, the landlord would have had to use a\\n30-day “no fault” Notice to Quit to try to evict you.51\\nRemember – A Notice to Quit is just the first step in the eviction process and\\ndoes not mean you have to move out by the date stated on the notice. No one can\\nlawfully remove you or your belongings from your apartment without a final\\norder of the court.\\nb. Consider Asking for a Lease\\nIf you decide you can pay the rent increase going forward and agree to the new\\nrent, but do not have a lease, you may want to negotiate a rental agreement or\\nlease to lock in your new rent for a specific time. Having the rent locked in by a\\nlease will prevent the landlord from demanding another rent increase in the near\\nfuture. For more see Chapter 4: What Kind of Tenancy Do I Have - Tenants\\nwith Leases.\\n▲ Chapter 5: Rent\\n\\n3. Refuse and Move\\nIf you do not want to pay the rent increase or cannot afford it, you should keep\\npaying the current rent while you look for a new apartment. As long as you keep\\npaying your current rent, your landlord is required to accept it.\\nIf you do not pay the increase, however, the landlord may decide to start an\\neviction case against you. But while you continue to pay the current rent, your\\nlandlord must use a 30-day Notice to Quit for a no-fault eviction (an eviction that\\nis not your fault). They cannot use a 14-day Notice to Quit for a non-payment of\\nrent. The reason is that although you have not agreed to pay the increase, you are\\npaying the agreed existing rent. For more see Chapter 12: Evictions - Receiving\\nProper Notice.\\na. If You Get a Notice to Quit\\nDo not ignore a notice to quit. However, if you get a Notice to Quit for any\\nreason, you do not have to move by the date stated on the notice. A Notice to\\nQuit is just the first required step to start an eviction case. This is a good time to\\ntry to negotiate an agreement with the landlord, because once your landlord has\\nfiled a case in court, this eviction will show up online on the Trial Court’s\\nwebsite.\\nIf you are unable to negotiate an agreement with your landlord, and your\\nlandlord brings an eviction case in court, there are steps to take to protect\\nyourself. Read Chapter 12: Eviction.\\nAlso, starting in May 2025, Massachusetts tenants will have the ability to seal\\ntheir eviction records depending on the type and outcome of the eviction. Check:\\nwww.masslegalhelp.org/housing-apartments-shelter/eviction-sealing\\nb. Landlord Accepts Current Rent after Notice to Quit\\nIf your landlord gives you a Notice to Quit, but after that accepts the old rent\\namount without clearly letting you know that the rent money is being accepted\\n\"for use and occupancy only,\" your landlord has accepted you back as a tenant\\nand has given up (waived) the right to evict you using the old Notice to Quit.52 If\\nthe landlord still wants to evict you, they must serve you with a new Notice to\\nQuit to terminate your re-established tenancy.\\nc. Final Court Order Necessary to Evict\\nIf you do not voluntarily leave, you can only be evicted from your apartment by\\nan order of the court. No one can move you out of your home without a final\\norder of the court (execution). There are several steps that must happen before\\nthe final order of the court. To learn more about the eviction process and how\\nyou can fight your case in court, see Chapter 12: Eviction.\\nChapter 5: Rent ▲\\n\\nd. Stay of Eviction\\nEven if a judge gives the landlord permission to evict you, you can ask the judge\\nfor up to 6 months to find another apartment. If you are elderly or disabled, you\\nmay ask for up to a year to find a new apartment.53 A judge will likely want to\\nsee that you are taking active steps to look for new housing and that you are\\ncontinuing to pay your rent.\\nIMPORTANT: There are many things to think through before you sign any\\nagreement in court. Unless you definitely have another place to go, be very\\ncareful about signing an agreement in court with the landlord that you will move\\nout by a certain date. If you are unable to move out by that date, the court\\nagreement form often says your landlord can get a judgment to evict you without\\nthe court ever hearing your case and an execution allowing a sheriff to forcibly\\nmove you out. For more see Negotiating a Settlement of Your Case (Booklet\\n11).\\n▲ Chapter 5: Rent\\n\\nEndnotes\\n1. In Massachusetts, your agreed-upon rent (“contract rent”) is the bargained-for value\\nof your apartment in a safe and non-defective condition. This means that regardless\\nof how much your rent is, your landlord is legally required to keep your residential\\nrental property up to minimum standards of human habitation set by the State\\nSanitary Code. This is a strict legal requirement known as the implied warranty of\\nhabitability. See Darmetko v. Boston Housing Authority, 378 Mass. 758 (1979);\\nMcKenna v. Begin, 3 Mass. App. Ct. 168, 170 (1975) (“Recognition of the implied\\nwarranty of habitability obliges the landlord to furnish habitable premises regardless\\nof the amount of rent charged…”).\\nIn some situations, rent may be paid in a form other than money, such as payment of\\nproperty taxes, utility bills, insurance, water and sewage. Ducker v. Ducker, 1997\\nMass. App. Div. 147, 1997 WL 606741 (“The term ‘rent’ may include, however, any\\ncompensation or consideration paid by the tenant for use of the premises, whether or\\nnot the amount has been defined....”), citing Story v. Lyon Realty Corp., 308 Mass.\\n66, 70 (1941) (“Any consideration sufficient to support a contract is all that is\\nrequired to constitute an agreement from which a tenancy may result.”). Compare\\nLavelle v. Lavelle, 2012 Mass. App. Div. 150, 151 (tenancy was gratuitous where no\\nevidence of any consideration exchanged for use of premises).\\n2. See McKenna, 3 Mass. App. Ct.. at 170-71 (“as the Hemingway case suggests, the\\nrent agreed upon is evidence of the value of the premises as habitable, and may not\\nbe taken by the judge as evidence of the value of the premises in a defective\\ncondition.”).\\n3. There are four primary sources of law that give tenants in Massachusetts the right to\\nresidential housing in decent, sanitary, and safe conditions: (1) the state codes,\\nincluding primarily, the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. §410.00; the State Building\\nCode, 780 C.M.R. §§1.00-22.00; the State Environmental Code, 310 C.M.R. §11; the\\nState Plumbing Code, 248 C.M.R. §2.00; the State Fuel Gas Code, 248 C.M.R.\\n§§4.00-8.00; the State Electrical Code, 527 C.M.R. §12.00; and the State\\nRegulations for Lead Poisoning Prevention and Control, 105 C.M.R. §460.000; (2)\\nlocal health ordinances; (3) the warranty of habitability; and (4) the covenant of quiet\\nenjoyment. For regulations that govern mobile home parks, motels, and recreational\\ncamps or cabins, see G.L. c. 140, §§32A-G. See Boston Housing Authority v.\\nHemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 200 n. 16 (1973) (“There may be instances where\\nconditions not covered by the [State Sanitary] Code regulations render the apartment\\nuninhabitable…. regardless of whether a sanitary code violation existed or not,”\\nbecause “the protection afforded by the implied warranty of habitability does not\\nnecessarily coincide with the [State Sanitary] Code\\'s requirements.”); Crowell v.\\nMcCaffrey, 377 Mass. 443, 451 (1979) (“We now find in the rental of a dwelling\\nunit, … an implied agreement by the landlord that the rented unit complies with the\\nminimum standards prescribed by building and sanitary codes and that he will do\\nwhatever those codes require for compliance during the term of the renting.”).\\nFurther, it may be an unfair or deceptive practice for an owner to “rent a dwelling\\nunit which, at the inception of the tenancy (1) contains a condition which amounts to\\na violation of law which may endanger or materially impair the health, safety or\\nwell-being of the occupant; or (2) is unfit for human habitation,” or to fail to\\ndisclose, misrepresent, or within a reasonable amount of time, repair the same.

However, when you move in, the most your landlord can charge in total is a first\\nmonth’s rent, a last month’s rent, a security deposit (which cannot be more than the\\nfirst month’s rent), and the cost of purchasing and installing a new lock. Last\\nmonth’s rent is regulated by G.L. c. 186, §15B(1)(b)(ii), (2)(a) and (7A); security\\ndeposit is regulated by G.L. c. 186, §15B(1)(b)(iii), 3(a)-(b), and (4); and key and\\nlock deposits are regulated by G.L. c. 186, §15B(1)(b)(iv).\\n8.

Whether a landlord accepts payment in full and waives (or reserves) their right to\\ndispute the rent is a question of fact that depends on the circumstances of each case.\\nYour landlord may attempt to reject your offer of payment in full: (a) by refusing to\\naccept or cash your check or (b) by cashing the check but subject to a “reservation of\\nrights” to continue to dispute the rent owed. Your landlord must notify you that the\\nare reserving their rights to continue to dispute the rent owed before or at the time\\nyou make the rent payment. Whitehouse Rest., Inc. v. Hoffman, 320 Mass. 183, 186\\n(1946).\\n15. To be effective, a reservation of rights must be communicated to you either before or\\nat the time your check is accepted. If a landlord writes a reservation of rights on the\\nback of your rent check but you could not know about this until after the check is\\ncashed and the cancelled check is returned to you by the bank, the reservation may\\nnot be valid. For example compare Whitehouse Rest., Inc., 320 Mass. at 186 (where\\na landlord merely endorses rent checks “received not for rent, but for use and\\noccupancy, the reservation was ineffective because it could not be communicated\\n“seasonably” in the course of banking business) with Ullian et al. v. Les Tuileries,\\nInc., 361 Mass. 863 (1972) (acceptance of rent by landlord did not operate as waiver\\nsince landlord gave timely notice that they did not intend to waive their rights); see\\nalso Mastrullo v. Ryan, 328 Mass. 621, 624 (1952) (notwithstanding written\\nreservation of rights on rent receipt, equivocal conduct by a landlord with respect to\\npayment and reservation of rights created a triable issue on whether there was a\\nwaiver).\\n16.

Massachusetts law requires a 14-day notice to terminate a tenancy for non-payment\\nof rent whether the tenancy is under a lease or a tenancy at will (no lease). See G.L.\\nc. 186, §§11-12. Massachusetts law also requires a 30-day (or rental period) notice\\nto terminate a tenancy at will for any reason other than non-payment of rent. See\\nG.L. c. 186, §§12-13. There is, however, no state law that requires a 30-day notice to\\nterminate a lease for any reason other than non-payment of rent. Typically, it is the\\nlease that will say what type of notice of termination is required and what reasons\\nother than nonpayment of rent, if any, are permissible grounds for terminating a\\nlease before it expires.\\n26.

DPU regulates gas, electric, privately owned water\\ncompanies (but not municipal water companies).1 Landline telephone companies\\nare regulated by the Department of Telecommunications and Cable (DTC) and\\noperate under a slightly different set of regulations.2\\nThe DPU has a special consumer division staffed by individuals who are trained\\nto help consumers when companies do not follow the law or refuse to make\\nreasonable agreements. DPU\\'s staff are not lawyers, and they will not represent\\nyou. However, DPU staff are often able to resolve many of the problems that\\ncustomers have with utility companies.\\nBefore contacting the DPU consumer division, you must first try to resolve your\\nproblem directly with the utility company. You can do this by contacting the\\nutility company\\'s Customer Service number or writing the company a letter. If\\nChapter 6: Utilities ▲\\n\\nthis fails to resolve the problem, contact the DPU Consumer Division and\\nexplain the problem, providing as many details as possible.\\nIf the DPU staff cannot help you, you can try speaking to a DPU Consumer\\nDivision supervisor.

There is no clear legal basis for refusing service to a\\nminor.

If You Owe Money from a Previous Address\\na. Electric and Gas\\nIf you owe an electric or gas company money from a previous address, the\\ncompany may say that it will not set up an account at your new address unless\\nyou pay the full amount owed (the arrearage) or arrange a payment plan\\nsatisfactory to the company. The companies often require payment of at least half\\nthe arrearage up-front, and sometimes much more than half. However, if you\\nnever failed to pay two or more bills in a row at your prior address, you have a\\nlegal right to set up a new account so long as you agree to pay off the total\\namount owed within three months.10 Also, if you receive HEAP benefits then the\\nutility companies cannot require you to make a payment of more than 25% of the\\narrearage.\\nIf you did go two or more months at your prior address without paying your bill,\\nthe company may still have to set up a new account for you as long as you do the\\nfollowing:\\nChapter 6: Utilities ▲\\n\\n§ Agree that the company may add the arrearage from your old address to\\nyour new account,\\n§ Set up a reasonable payment plan to pay it off, and\\n§ Give the company permission to terminate your new account if you fail to\\nkeep to the payment plan.\\nSome companies call this agreement a \"Cromwell Waiver\" while others no\\nlonger use that name.11 This is a document that gives the electric or gas company\\nthe permission to add the old arrearage to your new account and to terminate\\nyour new account if you do not pay it off, which the company would not\\notherwise be able to do.\\nYou should only sign a Cromwell Waiver if you have an old arrearage that is\\ncausing the utility company to deny you service at your new address.\\nOnce you sign the Cromwell Waiver, you need to set up a payment plan. The\\ncompany must agree to a payment plan that is reasonable, taking your income\\nlevel into consideration. For tips on setting up a plan, see the section in this\\nchapter on Getting Help Paying Your Bills. If you qualify for a special\\nprotection, you should tell this to the utility company. See the section in this\\nchapter on Special Protections Against Shut-offs.\\nIf the gas or electric company refuses to let you sign a Cromwell Waiver and set\\nup a reasonable payment plan to dispose of your old arrearage, contact the DPU\\nconsumer division for assistance.12\\nb. Wireline Telephone\\nWireline telephone companies are more resistant to setting up new accounts for\\ncustomers who owe money on old accounts. There are no rules specifically\\naddressing the situation of customers seeking new service who owe the phone\\ncompany money from a prior address. You also may be able to set up a new\\naccount by negotiating a payment plan with the telephone company to pay off\\nwhat you owe. If the company will not agree to a payment plan that is reasonable\\nbased on your income, contact the DTC consumer line, at\\n800-392-6066 or consumer.complaints@mass.gov. A DTC consumer staff\\nperson may be able to help you negotiate a better plan.\\n▲ Chapter 6: Utilities\\n\\n3. Deposits\\na. Electric and Gas\\nA company cannot charge you a deposit for residential electric and gas when you\\nfirst receive service.13\\nb. Wireline Telephone\\nA wireline telephone company may charge you a deposit of up to $50 if you owe\\nthem money from an old address and if you do not dispute the old bill. The\\ntelephone company may also require a deposit if you were previously shut off for\\nfailing to pay your bills. If you do pay a deposit and then pay your bills on time\\nfor six months, the telephone company must return your deposit, with interest,\\nupon your request.14\\n4. Installation Fees\\na. Electric and Gas\\nElectric and gas companies generally do not charge installation fees to connect\\nyour services.15\\nb. Wireline Telephone\\nThe telephone company routinely charges fees to connect a wireline telephone\\n(as opposed to wireless) in your house to the central office. They also routinely\\ncharge for any requests you make for service, home wiring, or additional jacks.\\nFor a list of these charges, contact the phone company.\\nNote that if your income is at or below 135% of the federal poverty guidelines,\\nor if you receive SSI, MassHealth Basic or Standard, SNAP (formerly Food\\nStamps), Veteran\\'s assistance or federal housing assistance, you may qualify for\\nthe \"Lifeline\" program. The Lifeline program provides internet, landline phone\\nor mobile phone service at a reduced cost.\\nFor more information about the Lifeline program, go to:\\nhttps://www.mass.gov/how-to/apply-for-a-discounted-communications-service-\\nthrough-the-lifeline-program.\\nChapter 6: Utilities ▲\\n\\nYour Right to Continued Service\\n1. Limited Grounds for Termination of Service\\nThe only reason your service can be shut off involuntarily is for failure to pay for\\nservice at your current address.16 (Also note that you may be able to get\\nterminated service restored even if you owe money from your current address;\\nsee the section in this chapter on Special Protections Against Shut-offs).\\nYou cannot be shut off for charges owed from a prior address or for money owed\\nby a prior occupant.17 You also cannot be shut off for non-service-related charges\\nsuch as rental fees on appliances purchased from a utility company or charges for\\nrepair work performed by the utility company.18\\n2. Your Landlord Fails to Pay\\nIf a landlord is responsible for the electricity or gas in your building and fails to\\npay the bills, a company cannot shut off service in the building until the tenants\\nhave been given at least 30 days\\' notice.19 Because many of these landlord-tenant\\ncases can become very complicated, you should immediately call the DPU if you\\nare in this situation and also try to get legal help. Do not expect to get legal help\\nfrom the DPU.\\nTenants can avoid the shut-off by banding together and agreeing to pay a\\n\"projected bill.\" You have a right to deduct from your rent any payments you\\nmake to the utility company, and you are protected from retaliation by the\\nlandlord. If you withhold rent for this purpose, you may also ask the DPU to\\nestablish a payment plan.\\nTenants generally cannot be held responsible for any portion of the landlord\\'s\\nprevious bills. The utility company can petition for a hearing at the DPU to show\\nthat the tenants should pay part or all of the previous bills, but to win such a\\nhearing the company has to prove that the tenants withheld more rent than it\\nwould take to pay the bills, that the tenants had no other reason for withholding\\nrent, and that it would not be an undue burden for the tenants to pay the bills.20\\nThe failure of a landlord to pay for and provide utilities to tenants will usually\\nviolate other state housing laws. For example, if a landlord does not provide\\nelectricity or gas for heat during the winter, they are violating the state Sanitary\\nCode. Tenants who bring lawsuits against landlords for these violations can win\\nup to three months\\' rent and attorneys\\' fees. Tenants may also want to ask the\\ncourt to appoint a temporary landlord called a receiver to manage the building.\\nFor more information on receiverships, see Chapter 11: Receiverships.\\n▲ Chapter 6: Utilities\\n\\nSpecial Protections Against Shut-offs\\nCustomers are often protected against a utility company\\'s shutting off their\\nservice, even if they cannot afford to pay their bills. These special protections are\\ndiscussed below.\\n1. Serious Illness or Personal Safety\\na. Electric, Gas, and Water\\nElectric, gas, and private water companies21 cannot shut off your service if you,\\nyour child, or someone else in your household is seriously ill and you cannot\\nafford to pay your bills because of financial hardship.22 The utility companies\\nmust treat any medical condition that a doctor, nurse practitioner or physician’s\\nassistant considers a serious illness as a serious illness, unless the company seeks\\na hearing at the DPU to challenge the medical letter. Serious illness can include\\nmental health conditions such as major depression, anxiety disorder, Post-\\nTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\\n(ADHD). It can also include chronic physical health problems such as diabetes,\\nasthma, and fibromyalgia. Or, it can be a temporary serious illness such as\\npneumonia or the flu.\\nTo protect yourself against a shut-off, you should take the following steps as\\nsoon as possible:\\n§ Contact your doctor, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, or the local\\nBoard of Health and explain your situation. Ask them to immediately\\ncontact the utility company by phone and tell the company that you are or\\nsomeone in your household is seriously ill. Make sure the doctor or Board\\nof Health has your name and address to give to the utility.\\nWithin seven days of this initial phone contact, the medical professional or\\nBoard of Health must send a letter to the utility company certifying the\\nillness. See the sample letter (Form 7) and sample form letter (Form 8)\\nthat can be given to your doctor to fill out. Tell your doctor to include the\\nwords \"serious illness\" in the letter and to describe the illness. If it is a\\nchronic or long-term illness, the doctor should include the words \"chronic\\nillness\" in the letter. A letter that states that the illness is a \"chronic illness\"\\nwill result in 180 days of protection before you have to renew, while a\\nletter that does not state this will result in only 90 days of protection. If\\nyou are uncomfortable having the utility know the type of illness, a letter\\nfrom the medical practitioner that simply includes the words “serious\\nillness” or “chronic, serious illness” should be sufficient.\\nNote: If the company refuses to honor the initial phone call from the\\ndoctor, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, or Board of Health, report\\nChapter 6: Utilities ▲\\n\\nthis immediately to the DPU\\'s Consumer Division and request that the\\nDPU order the company to continue your service.\\n§ Contact the company and ask them to send you a financial hardship form.\\nThe financial hardship form may also be available on your utility\\ncompany’s website. You must complete and submit this form as proof that\\nyou are unable to pay the amount you owe.\\n§ Your doctor, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, or the Board of\\nHealth will need to send a new letter at the end of the protected period\\n(180 days for an illness certified as chronic and 90 days for an illness not\\ncertified as chronic). Serious illness letters can be renewed for as long as\\nthe illness persists.\\nb. Wireline Telephone\\nSome land line telephone customers are eligible for a similar \"serious illness\"\\nprotection.23 However, the doctor\\'s letter must be renewed every 30 days even if\\nthe illness is specified as chronic, with a maximum of two renewals (a maximum\\ntotal of 90 days of protection). By the end of the protection period, you must\\neither pay the total amount owed or enter into a payment plan with the company\\nin order to prevent shut-off.\\nYou can also receive up to 30 days of protection when there is a \"personal\\nemergency\" in which lack of access to a phone endangers the health or safety of\\na household member.24\\nA personal emergency can include domestic violence or threats from a past\\nabuser, or any other crisis or threat that requires access to a phone. If you need\\nprotection from shut-off because of an emergency, you must write a letter to the\\ncompany explaining your emergency and why you are unable to pay your bills.\\nYou should also call the company and alert a Customer Service representative to\\nyour situation. By the end of the 30-day protection period, you must either pay\\nthe amount that you owe or enter into a payment plan with the company.\\nIf you have difficulty getting a phone company to protect your account from\\nshut-off based on a serious illness or personal emergency, call the DTC\\nConsumer Division at (800) 392-6066. Even though there are regulations that set\\ncertain time limits as to how long the telephone company is required to give\\nprotection, if you need protection you should try to persuade the company to\\nextend the protection period.\\n▲ Chapter 6: Utilities\\n\\n2. Winter Protection\\na. Electric and Gas\\nElectric and gas companies cannot shut off your service between November 15\\nand March 15 if you cannot afford to pay your utility bills and if the service is\\nused to heat your house. (This March 15 end-date is often extended to April 1 by\\nthe DPU.) To get the protection, you need only to fill out a financial hardship\\nform.25\\nIf you think you may have trouble paying winter heat bills, call your company\\nand ask them to send you a financial hardship form. Fill it out and return it as\\nsoon as possible. After you do this, you are protected against a shut-off between\\nNovember 15 and March 15 (or a later date, if the DPU extends the winter\\nmoratorium).\\n3. Families with Infants\\na. Electric, Gas, and Water\\nElectric, gas, and private water companies cannot shut off your service if you\\ncannot afford to pay your bill and if there is an infant under one year old living in\\nyour house.26 To get this protection, you must submit a financial hardship form.\\nYou must also prove your child\\'s age, through a birth certificate, letter, or official\\ndocument from a physician, hospital, government agency, clergy, or religious\\ninstitution.\\n4. Elderly Households\\na. Electric, Gas, Water, and Telephone\\nIf you and all the adult members of your household are 65 years or older, it is\\nvery difficult for a company to shut off utility service—so difficult that it almost\\nnever happens. (If the elderly household is also low-income, the prohibition on\\nterminating service is definite.) The rules covering electric, gas, water, and\\ntelephone service shut-offs for elderly households require the following:27\\n§ Companies must establish procedures to identify households in which all\\nadult members are 65 or older. To protect yourself, you should notify the\\nutility company if every adult in your household is 65 or older.\\n§ Companies must allow elderly households to identify a third-party contact\\nperson who can warn them if a utility company threatens to shut off\\nservice. To get this protection, contact your utility company and ask for a\\nThird Party Notification Form. You can name a friend, relative, or home-\\ncare provider as a third party. After you give a company this form, the\\nChapter 6: Utilities ▲\\n\\ncompany must then notify your third party of all overdue bills and shut-off\\nnotices. This third party is not legally responsible for paying your bill.\\n§ Companies cannot shut off service to elderly households without written\\npermission from the DPU. Because this would involve a hearing before\\nthe DPU, companies rarely even request permission to shut off service to\\nelders.\\nWhat to Do to Restore Your Service\\nMost of the grounds for preventing termination of service are also grounds for\\ngetting service restored once it has been shut off.\\n1. If You Qualify for a Special Protection\\nIf your utility service has already been terminated, you have the right to get it\\nrestored if you are eligible for any of the protections discussed in the Special\\nProtections Against Shut-offs section in this chapter. Note, however, that this\\nright to get service restored is not indefinite.\\nWhile the DPU has never defined how long after a termination a customer can\\nask to have service restored based on a Special Protection, companies may refuse\\nto restore service if the customer has been terminated for 90 days or more. If you\\nare trying to get service restored, but the company refuses because it claims you\\nare no longer a customer or have been terminated too long, contact the DPU\\nConsumer Division.\\nPutting aside the question about how long a customer retains the right to restore\\nterminated service, the utility company must restore your service if you can\\nshow financial hardship and one of the following:\\nFor Electricity, Gas, Private Water Company and Wireline Telephone: A\\nhousehold member is seriously ill. This can include an adult, child, or other\\nhousehold members who has any physical, mental, or emotional condition or\\nhealth problem that a doctor (or certain other healthcare providers) believes is a\\nserious illness.\\n▲ Chapter 6: Utilities\\n\\n§ For Electricity, Gas, Private Water Company, and Wireline\\nTelephone: Every adult in the household is over age 65 and the company\\nhas not gotten permission from DPU to terminate service.\\n§ For Electricity, Gas, and Private Water: A child under 1 year of age is\\nliving in the home, whether or not the child was born before the service\\nwas terminated for non-payment.\\n§ For Electricity and Gas: It is between November 15 and March 15 and\\nthe utility provides heat or is needed to run the furnace or heating system.\\n§ For Telephone: You have a personal emergency requiring access to a\\nphone.\\nIf your household is eligible for one of these protections, you should notify the\\ncompany immediately. To do this, follow the steps outlined in the Special\\nProtections Against Shut-offs section in this chapter. If the company refuses to\\nrestore your service, call DPU (or DTC, in the case of telephone service) for\\nassistance.\\n2. If the Company Did Not Follow Proper\\nProcedures\\nIf the company did not follow the procedures listed in the next section in this\\nchapter, called Your Rights During the Termination Process, before shutting\\noff your service, it should restore your service and go through the proper\\nprocedures. You should call the company immediately; explain which\\nprocedures were not followed and ask that your service be restored until the\\nproper procedures are followed and you are given a chance to respond to them. If\\nthe company refuses, call the DPU.\\n3. If You Are Trying to Set Up an Account\\nat a New Address\\nIf you are trying to set up an electricity or gas account at a new address and you\\nowe the company money, you may have to sign a \"Cromwell Waiver\" (some\\ncompanies do not have a particular name for the form) which states that you are\\nstill responsible for the prior bills and that your new service can be terminated if\\nyou fail to pay them. You must then set up a payment plan for paying off the old\\narrearage. The company will often require that you pay half of the arrearage up-\\nfront. If you cannot do this and cannot get the company to agree to a different\\narrangement, call the DPU for assistance. For more information, see the section\\nin this chapter called Your Right to Obtain Service.\\nChapter 6: Utilities ▲\\n\\nYour Rights During the Termination\\nProcess\\n1. Electric, Gas, and Water28\\nIf a company tries to shut off your service for failure to pay for service at your\\ncurrent address, it must comply with the following procedures:\\n§ The company must first send the initial bill. You have at least 48 days\\nfrom the day that you receive this initial bill until a company can shut off\\nyour service for not paying the bill.\\n§ The company must then send you a reminder notice called a \"Second\\nRequest for Payment.\" The company must wait at least 27 days after\\nsending you the first bill before sending you a reminder notice.\\n§ The company must send you a \"Final Notice of Termination.\" It must wait\\nuntil 45 days after sending you the first bill before sending you a final\\nnotice. This notice must give you at least 72 hours\\' (three days\\') notice as\\nto when the termination will actually happen for gas and electricity, or 36\\nhours\\' (one and a half days’) notice for water. 29\\n§ A company cannot terminate your account for non-payment of any portion\\nof any bill that you are disputing.30 If you think that you have been billed\\nincorrectly, you can dispute your bill by contacting the company by phone,\\nmail, or in person. The company then must investigate your claim and\\nnotify you in writing of the results of the investigation. If you disagree\\nwith the company\\'s findings, you can file an appeal at the DPU and\\nrequest a hearing.\\n§ Any company employee attempting to shut off your service must first see\\nif anyone is home and explain to that person that service is about to be\\nterminated. The employee must present that person with a notice\\ndescribing all of the special termination protections, which include serious\\nillness, infants, winter protection, and the protection for elders. The\\nemployee must postpone the shut-off for three days if you claim any of the\\nprotections. If no one is home, however, the company can shut off your\\n▲ Chapter 6: Utilities\\n\\nservice, but must leave a financial hardship form and a notice describing\\navailable protections under your door.\\n§ Shut-offs can be done only between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through\\nThursday. Shut-offs cannot be done on a Friday, Saturday, Sunday,\\nholiday, or the day before a holiday.\\n§ During the winter months, electric and gas companies must call you or\\nnotify you in person before shutting off your heat-related service.31\\n2. Telephone32\\nFor some land line telephone customers, telephone companies must follow\\ntermination procedures similar to those required of electric, gas, and water\\ncompanies, with the following differences:\\n§ You have a minimum of 45 days, rather than 48 days, between the initial\\nbill and a potential shut-off. A telephone company has to wait 30 days\\nafter sending you an initial bill before it can send you a first termination\\nnotice, and the first termination notice has to be sent 15 days before the\\nshut-off date.\\n§ The telephone company does not have to send you a second request for\\npayment before sending you the first termination notice. However, the\\ncompany must send you two termination notices, the second of which\\nmust be sent five days before the shut-off.\\n§ Regardless of the season, telephone companies must make at least one\\ntelephone call to inform you that a shut-off is scheduled. If no one\\nanswers, however, the shut-off can be completed.33\\n§ There is no requirement that a company employee attempting to shut off\\nyour service check to see if you are at home or leave information under\\nyour door.\\nGetting Help Paying Your Bills\\n1. Payment Plans\\nMany customers cannot afford to pay their utility bills and are not eligible for\\nany of the special protections against shut-offs previously discussed in the\\nsection in this chapter called Special Protections Against Shut-offs. If you find\\nyourself in this situation, you still are eligible for a payment plan.\\nChapter 6: Utilities ▲\\n\\nUtility companies must provide customers with payment plans that allow a\\ncustomer to take several months to pay overdue bills.34 You have the absolute\\nright to spread payment of overdue bills over a minimum of four months.\\nDo not agree to pay more in a shorter amount of time if you cannot afford it.\\nIf your budget does not allow you to pay the balance in four months, you should\\nask for a longer amount of time. Try to work out an acceptable payment plan\\nwith the company. If you qualify for the discount rate and/or fuel assistance (see\\nthe sections below) and have not received them, tell the company that you will\\napply and that this will reduce your future bills. This should make the company\\nwilling to negotiate a better payment plan (such as requiring less money up-\\nfront), since it indicates that you will be in a better position to make payments in\\nthe future.\\nFinally, you may be able to reduce the amount that you owe the company, and\\nthereby get the company to agree to a better payment plan, by getting the low-\\nincome discount applied retroactively to your account. For more information see\\nthe following section, Discount Rates.\\nIf the utility company won\\'t allow you enough time to pay your overdue bill, call\\nthe DPU and say that you want a longer payment plan than the company is\\noffering because you can\\'t afford to pay more quickly.\\nFor many customers, “Arrearage Management Programs” (discussed below) are\\na better option than a regular payment plan, since the customer is only obligated\\nto pay current bills as they arrive, and not required to pay off the amount in\\narrears.\\n2. Discount Rates\\na. Getting Discounted Rates on Future Bills\\nState law requires all non-municipal electric and gas companies to provide\\ndiscounted rates to low-income customers who receive or are eligible for public\\nbenefits.35 You can get a discount on your electric and gas bills if your income is\\nat or below 60% of state median income (see the chart at the end of this chapter)\\nand you receive any benefits under any income-tested benefits program,\\nincluding (but not limited to) the following benefits:\\n▲ Chapter 6: Utilities\\n\\n§ TAFDC, cash assistance,\\n§ EAEDC, cash assistance,\\n§ SSI, cash assistance,\\n§ State Veterans Services benefits,\\n§ Women, Infant & Children (WIC) benefits\\n§ Emergency Assistance shelter benefits,\\n§ SNAP benefits (formerly Food Stamps),\\n§ Most MassHealth programs,\\n§ Refugee Resettlement Program benefits,\\n§ HEAP (formerly called LIHEAP or fuel assistance),\\n§ Certain kinds of veterans\\' benefits, or\\n§ If your child is enrolled in Head Start or the School Breakfast or School\\nLunch Program.\\nThe discounted rates can lower your bills by 25% or more, depending on the\\ncompany, and therefore can save you a substantial amount of money each year.\\nYou can also get discounts from most local telephone companies if you receive\\nvarious public benefits, including SSI, MassHealth Basic or Standard, SNAP\\n(formerly Food Stamps), HEAP (fuel assistance), free school lunch, Head Start,\\nVeteran\\'s assistance or federal housing assistance.\\nThe \"Lifeline\" program provides discounted landline, mobile phone, or\\nbroadband service to eligible households.\\nFor more information about Lifeline in Massachusetts: mass.gov/how-to/apply-\\nfor-a-discounted-communications-service-through-the-lifeline-program.\\nb. Getting the Discounts Applied Retroactively\\nThere are three different ways that discount rates can be applied retroactively.\\nFirst, some companies may put customers who receive HEAP onto the discount\\nrates as of November 1, regardless of when the customer actually applies for and\\ngets approved for HEAP during the winter months. There are no rules or\\nregulations that require companies to do this, but some companies will do this if\\nrequested by the customer.\\nChapter 6: Utilities ▲\\n\\nSecond, if you apply on your own to get the discount rates, you should (but may\\nnot) be placed on the discount rate back to the day of application. For example, if\\nthe company takes two months to process the discount rate application, you\\nshould not lose two months of the discount, but should instead ask to be placed\\non the discount rate as of the date of your application. But, again, there are no\\nrules or regulations that require the company to do so.\\nThird, every regulated gas and electric company in the state has voluntarily\\nagreed that it will place customers on the discount rate retroactively if the\\ncustomer has in fact been eligible for the rate for some period of time but did not\\nknow to apply. National Grid has formally adopted this practice in a written\\npolicy.36\\nSome of the companies do not consistently comply with this\\nagreement. Customers themselves cannot call the company to ask for this\\ntype of retroactive application of the discount. Only advocates can do so, on\\nbehalf of their clients-customers, and only certain specified individuals at\\nthe companies will respond to these requests. If you are an advocate and need\\nmore information about how to contact the company regarding retroactive\\napplication of the discount, contact the National Consumer Law Center\\nat stayconnected@nclc.org.\\n3. Arrearage Management Programs\\nEach electric and gas company offers an “Arrearage Management Program”\\n(AMP). In an AMP, the company provides a credit against overdue amounts\\n(arrearages) every time the customer pays the current monthly bill.\\nFor example, if a customer owes $1,200 and the company estimates that the\\ncustomer’s bills will be $1,800 over the next 12 months ($150 per month), the\\nAMP generally works as follows: the company bills the customer the $150 every\\nmonth, levelizing the bills so they are the same every month. Every time the\\ncustomer makes a payment of $150, the company provides a credit against the\\noverdue amount, often 1/12 of that amount. In this case, the credit would be $100\\n(1/12 of the $1,200 arrearage) every time the customer makes a payment. While\\nthe details vary from company to company, the concept is the same: customers\\nare rewarded with credits against the arrearage every time they pay the current\\nmonthly bill.\\nTo find out how to enroll in your company’s AMP, call the customer service\\nnumber on your bill.\\n▲ Chapter 6: Utilities\\n\\n4. Fuel Assistance Program\\nThe state operates a fuel assistance program that assists low-income households\\nin paying their heating-related bills, which is called the Home Energy Assistance\\nProgram (HEAP). The program is run by the Executive Office of Housing and\\nLivable Communities (EOHLC). Gas customers are eligible for fuel assistance\\npayments only if they use gas for home heating. Electric customers are eligible if\\nthey heat with electricity and sometimes may receive payments on the electric\\nbill if they use electricity to operate their heating system; for example, if the\\nmotors or fans on an oil-fired furnace run on electricity. For those who heat with\\noil, propane, kerosene, coal, or wood, the program pays whichever company\\ndelivers that fuel.\\nAll households (except certain non-citizens) earning less than 60% of state\\nmedian income are financially eligible for fuel assistance.\\nThe actual amount of assistance has varied somewhat over the past several years.\\nThe amount that you receive will depend on your income, household size, and\\nwhether you live in subsidized housing.\\nYou must apply for fuel assistance between November and April. To find out\\nwhere to apply in your area, call 800-632-8175 or review the Cold Relief\\nbrochure at https://www.mass.gov/info-details/learn-about-home-energy-\\nassistance-heap. The Cold Relief brochure also lists the income eligibility limits\\nfor HEAP.\\nThe Fiscal Year 2025 version of the brochure can be found here: mass.gov/info-\\ndetails/learn-about-home-energy-assistance-heap. The Cold Relief brochure also\\nlists the income eligibility limits for HEAP.\\n5. Private Sources\\nMany utility companies voluntarily participate in a program called the Good\\nNeighbor Fund, run by the Salvation Army.\\nThis fund provides modest payments to help people pay their gas, electric, and\\noil bills. To be eligible for payments, a family must have income between 60%\\nand 80% of the state median income. To find out more about the Good Neighbor\\nFund, contact your local Salvation Army or go to:\\nwww.magoodneighbor.org/assistance.html.\\nIn addition to the Good Neighbor Fund, there are statewide and local charities\\nthat sometimes help people with their heating bills. There is no central listing of\\nall of these charitable sources, but a good place to start is by calling the United\\nChapter 6: Utilities ▲\\n\\nWay, the local chapter of St. Vincent dePaul, or local churches. In addition, each\\nlocal fuel assistance agency knows of charities that can help pay energy bills.\\n6. Relocation Benefits\\nThere are some relocation benefits available to help with utility arrears or\\ndeposits.\\nDepartment of Transitional Assistance\\nThe Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) will pay up to $1,000 to help\\nget permanent housing for some families who are leaving a shelter or a teen\\nliving program. This benefit may be used for advance rent, security deposit, rent\\narrears, utility arrears or deposits, storage, moving expenses, or other relocation\\ncosts. The relocation benefit is available through a DTA worker for:\\n§ a family receiving TAFDC cash assistance or EAEDC cash assistance who\\nhas been in emergency shelter for 60 days or more,\\n§ a family receiving TAFDC cash assistance who has been in a domestic\\nviolence shelter for 60 days or more, or\\n§ a teen parent age 18 or 19 who has been in a structured teen living\\nprogram for 60 days or more and can live independently.37\\nDTA will pay the benefit directly to the vendor, such as the landlord, utility, or\\nstorage company. You cannot get reimbursement for expenses you’ve already\\npaid directly.\\nYou can get the $1,000 relocation benefit only once in a 12-month period.\\nFamilies can receive both a relocation benefit and HomeBase assistance (see\\nbelow) as long as those payments are not covering the same item.\\nResidential Assistance for Families in Transition\\nThe Executive of Housing and Livable Communities (EOHLC) has several\\nprograms that may assist with relocation. Residential Assistance for Families in\\nTransition (RAFT) is a homelessness prevention program that can provide\\nrelocation assistance of up to $7,000. You may be able to use the money for rent,\\nutilities, moving costs, and mortgage payments. To apply or find out if you are\\neligible, visit mass.gov/how-to/apply-for-raft-emergency-help-for-housing-costs.\\nHomeBASE\\nIf you are experiencing or are at imminent risk of homelessness and are pregnant\\nor have a child under 21, you may be eligible for Emergency Assistance (EA)\\nshelter. If you are found eligible for EA you may also apply for HomeBASE\\nbenefits to help you avoid going into shelter or help you leave shelter.\\n▲ Chapter 6: Utilities\\n\\nHomeBASE can currently provide at least $30,000 over 24 months to be used for\\nrent, utility arrears or other expenses.38 The EA shelter program, including\\nHomeBASE, is run by EOHLC.\\nTo apply or find out if you are eligible, visit mass.gov/info-\\ndetails/homebase#what-can-homebase-pay-for?- .\\nFor more information see the Emergency Assistance Advocacy Guide prepared\\nby the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, available at\\nwww.masslegalhelp.org/homelessness/emergency-assistance/advocacy-guide.\\nSupplemental Security Income Special Benefits\\nIndividuals who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) may be eligible for\\nstate-funded Special Benefits of up to $150 in moving costs to move within the\\nstate if the current living situation has been certified as substandard; a move is\\nrequired due to health, safety, or other conditions; or the individual is moving\\ninto subsidized housing. Special Benefits for SSI recipients may also be available\\nto cover the cost of replacing furniture, household equipment, food, clothing, or\\nsupplies lost as a result of a fire or other natural disaster. Ask about Special\\nBenefits at your local DTA office.\\nFor more information and help getting the benefit go to:\\nhttps://www.masslegalservices.org/content/moving-benefit-ssi-recipients-150-\\ncash-payment-dta.\\nLowering Your Bills Further\\nBesides applying for the low-income discount, fuel assistance, the Good\\nNeighbor Fund, and/or funds from other private sources, you can take the\\nfollowing steps to reduce your monthly electricity and gas bills.\\n1. Continuous Level Billing\\nIf you have trouble paying your heating bills in the winter, you may want to\\nconsider this payment option for your heat source utility. With continuous level\\nbilling, the company averages your usage from the past year in order to estimate\\nyour average monthly bill. You are then billed this fixed amount every month.\\nFor example: Assume you have electric heat and pay $200 per month for the six\\nmonths when the weather is cold, but only $60 per month for the six months\\nwhen the weather is warm. Your average monthly bill is $130 per month. With\\ncontinuous level billing, the company would bill you $130 each month year-\\nround, so that you can avoid ever having to pay out $200 at one time.\\nCompanies generally enroll customers on level billing plans during the summer\\nand fall months and require that the customer be current on their bills to be able\\nto enroll. However, since the levelized bills are estimates, every several months\\nChapter 6: Utilities ▲\\n\\nthe company will send a “true up” bill (up or down) to correct for any differences\\nbetween the estimates and actual usage.\\n2. Weatherization and Heating System Programs\\nYour heating and cooling bills may be too high due to drafts, cracks, poor\\ninsulation, or an inefficient or broken heating system. Weatherizing your house\\nor apartment and repairing your heating system can significantly reduce your\\nbills.\\nThere are local organizations across Massachusetts that receive funding from the\\nU.S. Department of Energy and from utility companies to provide weatherization\\nassistance to low-income tenants and homeowners. To qualify for this assistance,\\nyour household income must be under 60% of median income.\\nIf you qualify, the organization will send a certified energy auditor to inspect\\nyour home. If the auditor finds that your home needs sealing, insulation,\\nweatherstripping, or minor repairs related to weatherization, or that your heating\\nsystem needs repair or replacement, the organization will hire a contractor to do\\nthe work at no cost to you. In addition, the local energy agency may also\\nrecommend, and pay for, installation of an air source heat pump (ASHP) to\\nreplace an existing heating system. An ASHP provides both heat in the winter\\nand heat in the summer.\\nTo find the nearest organization offering weatherization services, call the\\nEOHLC Heatline at 800-632-8175 or see the Cold Relief brochure, the most\\nrecent version can be found here: https://www.mass.gov/info-details/learn-\\nabout-home-energy-assistance-heap.\\n3. Getting Repairs Made\\nIf your windows, flooring, walls, heating system, or thermostat need repairs, this\\ncan increase your heating and cooling bills substantially. Your landlord is\\nresponsible for keeping your apartment in safe and habitable condition. See\\nChapter 8: Getting Repairs Made for information on what to do.\\n▲ Chapter 6: Utilities\\n\\nCommon Problems and Situations to\\nAvoid\\n1. Another Person\\'s Bill\\na. Deserted spouse and domestic violence situations\\nA victim of domestic violence who remains in the home after the perpetrator\\nleaves (whether after getting an order that the perpetrator leave, or for other\\nreasons) is not responsible for bills rendered in the name of the perpetrator. To\\nobtain the benefit of this rule, you should call the utility company and ask that a\\nnew account be opened in your name. You should do this as quickly as possible.\\nIf you do not inform the company that your spouse or domestic partner has left, a\\ndispute will often arise as to when they actually left. The company may also\\nclaim that you accepted responsibility for your spouse\\'s old bills by leaving the\\naccount in their name for as long as you did. Therefore, it is strongly\\nrecommended that you make the change promptly.\\nb. Roommate\\nWhen a roommate who is the customer named on the utility bill moves out of\\nan apartment, the remaining roommate is not responsible for the departed\\nroommate\\'s bills.39 For purposes of this rule, two unmarried people living\\ntogether would be considered “ roommates.”\\nc. Landlord Transfers Bill to Tenant\\nWhen a landlord wishes to transfer responsibility for a utility bill from themself\\nto a tenant, they cannot simply do so by calling the company. The tenant must\\nagree in writing with the landlord and the utility must be separately metered.40 If\\nyou have not agreed in writing to a utility bill being put in your name, call the\\nutility company and ask that the bill be taken out of your name. If your landlord\\nthen refuses to pay the bill, the company cannot shut off your service without\\ngiving you notice. For more information, see the section in this chapter called\\nYour Right to Continued Service.\\nChapter 6: Utilities ▲\\n\\n2. Estimated Bills\\nUtility companies are required to read your meter on a regular basis. When they\\nread your meter and send you a bill, your bill is based on your actual use. Utility\\ncompanies are also allowed to send customers \"estimated bills\" based on your\\nestimated use. The problem with too many estimated bills is that if the company\\nestimates your utility use on the low side, you eventually will receive a large\\n\"catch-up\" bill once a company reads your meter and determines your actual use.\\nCompanies can also estimate on the high side and you may be paying more than\\nyou should.\\nYou will know if it is an estimated bill because the word \"ESTIMATE\" must\\nappear clearly on the face of the bill. A company may alternate between bills\\nbased on a meter reading one month and on estimated use the next month. A\\ncompany cannot, however, send you two estimated bills in a row unless:\\n§ You deny the company access to the meter, or\\n§ The company cannot read the meter for reasons beyond its control.41\\nIf you want your bill to be based on your actual use every month, you may be\\nable to read the meter yourself and report your reading to the company over the\\nphone or through a meter reading card provided by the company. However, this\\nmay not be available at all companies. You can also contact the company and\\nmake arrangements for your meter to be read at a time when you will be home,\\nincluding in the evening or on a Saturday.\\n3. Excessively High Bills and Illegal Metering\\nProblems\\nCustomers often complain that their utility bills are too high. Unfortunately, the\\nreason in most cases is simply that rates are so high. If you heat with gas or\\nelectricity, your utility bills can easily exceed $2,000 per year. Even the\\nelectricity needed to run lights, a refrigerator, and a few other appliances can cost\\n$150 or more per month.\\na. Illegal Tapping\\nA high bill may, however, indicate that you have a problem. In some cases,\\nsomeone may be illegally tapping into your utility lines—that is, someone may\\nbe using utility service from the line you pay for. This is more common in\\napartment buildings, where all the meters may be accessible in a common area,\\nsuch as a basement. If you suspect that your gas or electrical service is being\\nillegally tapped or diverted, call the utility company and the DPU.\\n▲ Chapter 6: Utilities\\n\\nAlthough neither the company nor the DPU is required by law to conduct a\\nthorough physical inspection of your premises for illegal tapping, they may offer\\nto test a meter or help in some fashion. If the company and the DPU can\\'t or\\nwon\\'t help you, you may have to hire an electrician or plumber to locate the\\nproblem.\\nb. Incorrect Metering\\nHigh bills may also occur when the landlord installs too few meters in a multi-\\nfamily building or attaches common-area lights or appliances to an individual\\ntenant\\'s meter. For example, a renovated Victorian house may now have three\\napartments, but only two meters. Or, the landlord may have hooked up the\\nhallway lights or a common dryer to your apartment\\'s meter, so that you are\\npaying for these on top of the charges for your own apartment. You may,\\ntherefore, be paying for your neighbor\\'s utilities as well as your own. These\\nsloppy metering practices are illegal under the state Sanitary Code.42\\nIf you believe that the owner has violated the provisions of the Sanitary Code\\nregarding metering requirements, call the local Board of Health and ask for an\\ninspection. If the Board of Health says that there is a metering problem, give a\\ncopy of the Board\\'s report to the utility company within 60 days. The law\\nrequires the utility company to switch your entire bill to your landlord\\'s name\\nuntil the Board of Health certifies that the problem has been fixed.\\nIf you paid for the heat, hot water, air conditioner, dryer, refrigerator, or freezer\\nof another apartment or common area, the company must also refund you all of\\nthe utility bills that you paid during the period of improper metering, up to two\\nyears. If the incorrect metering resulted in your paying only for a common-area\\nlight, doorbell, and/or smoke or fire alarm, the company will refund you a total\\nof $10 per month for the relevant period.43\\nThere is another kind of incorrect metering, called cross-metering, when the\\nmeters of two apartments are completely crossed. In this situation, each tenant is\\nbeing billed for the utilities used by the other apartment. The DPU has ruled that\\nwhen this kind of cross-metering is the fault of the utility company, the customer\\ncannot be held responsible. If you think that you are being billed for someone\\nelse\\'s energy use instead of your own, call the utility company and ask the\\ncompany to \"flash\" your meter. If it turns out that your meter has been crossed\\nwith someone else\\'s due to the company\\'s negligence and that you have been\\novercharged, the company will not be allowed to collect for any excess usage\\nthat was not previously billed. If it turns out that you were undercharged, the\\ncompany cannot require you to make up the difference if the cross-metering was\\ndue to the company\\'s negligence.44\\nChapter 6: Utilities ▲\\n\\nc. Defective Appliances\\nYou may have defective or inefficient appliances that are using too much\\nelectricity or gas, thus causing unusually high bills. Again, you can try calling\\nthe utility company to see if they can offer any help. But you may have to hire a\\nplumber or electrician to get a satisfactory answer to your problem. If the\\nappliances belong to the property owner, they may have an obligation to keep\\nthem in good working order under the state Sanitary Code.\\n4. Who\\'s Responsible for Paying Bills\\nYour landlord may legally be responsible for utility bills that you have verbally\\nagreed to pay. The state Sanitary Code requires a landlord to pay for the fuel\\nused for hot water and space heating, as well as other electric and gas bills,\\nunless you have signed a written agreement stating that you are responsible for\\nthese bills.45 If you have not agreed in writing to pay these bills, the landlord\\ncannot make you pay them.\\nHowever, if you pay the bills under a verbal agreement, you may have trouble\\ngetting the landlord to reimburse you later. The Massachusetts courts agree that it\\nis a deceptive practice under the state\\'s consumer rights law for a landlord to\\nforce a tenant to pay utility bills without a written agreement. However, even if\\nthere is such an agreement, the courts usually will not order a landlord to\\nreimburse the tenant for bills that the tenant has already paid. Instead, the courts\\nsimply award the tenant $25 in damages and require the landlord to pay the\\ntenant\\'s legal fees.\\nThere are two exceptions to this: If the tenant can show that they had to live\\nwithout utilities for any period of time as a result of the landlord\\'s not paying the\\nbills, a court may award more money. Also, if the tenant can show that the\\ncombined cost of their rent and their utility bills is more than the fair market\\nvalue of the apartment with utilities included, the court may award the tenant the\\ndifference between the two amounts.46\\n5. The Risk of Competitive Supply and Certain\\nSolar Sales\\nThere are two types of energy transactions which carry the risks of consumer\\nharm: competitive supply of energy, and certain solar sales. Consumers should\\nbe wary of each, but particularly competitive supply of electricity\\n▲ Chapter 6: Utilities\\n\\na. Competitive supply of electricity\\nFor more than two decades now, most electric and gas customers have been able\\nto buy their supply of electricity or gas from largely unregulated, competitive\\ncompanies. The electricity is still delivered by the regulated company, such as\\nEversource, National Grid, Unitil, and the regulated company sends the bills,\\nmaintains the lines and infrastructure, and provides customer service.\\nCustomers obtain their supply of competitive electricity or gas in two ways:\\neither by individually signing up with a competitive supplier, or because they\\nlive in a city or town that has “aggregated” the customers in that municipality,\\nand the municipality has chosen a competitive supplier for its residents. This\\nlatter “municipal aggregation” approach has posed few problems for consumers.\\nBut when individuals sign up for competitive supply, there are a host of\\nproblems.\\nFirst, some individuals who have competitive supply never actually signed up!\\nA salesperson may have come to their door, or called by phone, and obtained\\nenough information about the individual to switch them to competitive supply\\nwithout permission. Beware of anyone coming to your door or approaching you\\nin a store who is claiming that they “work for the electric company” or\\n“guarantee that your bills will go down.” Do not give out your account number\\nor personal information unless you are sure you know who you are dealing with\\nand want to switch.\\nSecond, studies by the Massachusetts Attorney General have documented that\\nthe vast majority of individuals who switch to competitive supply paid more —\\noften, much more — than if they had just stayed with the regulated distribution\\ncompany such as Eversource, National Grid, and Unitil. While a relatively few\\ncustomers have saved a relatively small amount of money, it requires a fair\\namount of research to find a deal where you will come out ahead.\\nThird, the competitive supply companies may offer incentives to switch to them,\\nsuch as a gift card, but those incentives rarely are worth paying the higher,\\nresulting electric bills.\\nIn general, customers should avoid switching. It is worth reviewing your electric\\nand gas bills carefully to make sure you have not unknowingly been switched to\\ncompetitive supply. Look at the “supplier” or “supplier charges” portion of your\\nbill. If there is any company name other than that of a regulated distribution\\ncompany, you may have been “slammed”: switched without your permission.\\nHowever, check with your city or town hall first, as you may live in a\\nmunicipality that has aggregated its residents. As noted at the beginning of this\\nsection, municipal aggregations have generally not resulted in customers paying\\nhigher bills; or, if so, only slightly higher.\\nChapter 6: Utilities ▲\\n\\nIf you think you’ve been slammed or otherwise harmed by a competitive\\nsupplier, you should file complaints with the DPU and the state Attorney\\nGeneral’s office.\\nAt DPU: 877 866-5066, or DPUConsumerComplaints@mass.gov\\nAt AG: 617 727-8400, or mass.gov/how-to/file-a-consumer-complaint\\nb. Solar energy\\nElectricity customers can obtain solar energy in two ways: by installing solar\\npanels on the roof, or by joining a “community solar” project.\\nOf course, renters don’t have a roof where they can install solar.\\nFor renters, community solar is far less risky, as it does not involve paying to\\ninstall the panels, nor is financing needed. However, there are risks involved in\\nterms of ensuring that the household’s energy bills will in fact be lower. Again,\\nbefore signing a community solar deal, it is best to consult a state agency or other\\ntrusted source for information, such as the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center.\\nSpecial Rules for Tenants Living in\\nCondominiums\\nIf you live in a condominium as a tenant and you face the loss or the threat of the\\nloss of utility service due to the failure of the association to pay utility or heat\\nbills, there are steps you can take to protect your rights.\\nThe DPU has published regulations that apply to condominiums. These\\nregulations also describe which other DPU rules apply to condo associations, to\\nindividual condo unit owners, and to tenants in condo units.47 The regulations\\nallow a condominium association to choose either the residential or commercial\\nrate of the utility company, whichever is cheaper.48\\nThe general DPU rules regarding pending bills, providing notice of termination,\\nand offering payment plans apply when condo associations are customers. When\\nunits are separately metered, companies must give individual condo unit owners\\nall special protections against shut-offs, as described in this chapter.49 When a\\ncondo unit is rented to a tenant, that tenant has all the rights described previously\\nin this chapter about when landlords fail to pay.50\\n▲ Chapter 6: Utilities\\n\\nEndnotes\\n1.

A\\nnew market for condos was created by a prosperous economy that attracted\\nyoung professionals and first-time home buyers who needed a cheaper form\\nof homeownership and sought entrance into the expensive real estate market.\\nApartments in Boston and its suburbs became vulnerable to condominium\\nconversion. Thousands of rental units were converted to condominium\\nownership.2 In some communities the entire stock of rental housing was\\nconverted.\\nAs condominiums continued to escalate in value, property owners converted\\ntheir rentals to condominiums and absentee owners bought condos as\\ninvestments. As a result, units previously affordable to lower-income\\nresidents were converted to condos and became unaffordable.3\\nIn 1983, in response to the threat of displacement tenants faced as a result of\\ncondo conversion, the state legislature passed a law that adopted certain basic\\nprotections for tenants. The law also allowed communities to adopt greater or\\ndifferent protections.4\\nIn the early 1990s, the condo market sagged and there was a glut of newly\\nconverted condos. While at first condos provided affordable shelter to young\\nfamilies, many owners became dissatisfied with the cumbersome rules and\\nregulations, as well as with the lack of freedom to make repairs or alterations\\nwithout condominium association approval. At the same time, absentee\\nowners of many condominiums saw their investments fail, causing them to\\nignore or abandon their responsibilities as owners. More and more\\ncondominiums fell into disrepair. In response, the state legislature adopted\\nmore laws to protect tenants and responsible condominium owners.\\nChapter 17: Condominium Control ▲\\n\\nIn the mid-1990s came the abolition of rent and eviction controls, coupled\\nwith a real estate boom. Market forces dramatically raised rent levels for\\ntenants, and the purchase of condominium units had become in many cases\\nunrealistic even for middle-income tenants.\\nDuring the foreclosure crisis in the 2000’s there was a lot of uncertainty in\\nthe market. Some of the tenants facing displacement due to foreclosure were\\nin units converted to condominiums, and some of these condo units were\\nlater reconverted to regular rental housing. Some of the properties were not\\ncovered by condo conversion protections because they had 3 units or less.\\nIn 2024, the state Legislature expanded tenant protections in conjunction with\\ncondo conversion to cover properties with less than four units where the\\nowner does not live in the property not previously converted or otherwise\\nexempt from coverage.5\\n▲ Chapter 17: Condominium Control\\n\\nKey Terms to Know\\nUnder both state and local condo laws, the following words usually mean:6\\nLow or Moderate Income = Your income is considered low or moderate if it is\\nless than or equals 80% of the median income in your area for a household of your\\nsize. Contact your local housing authority for the figure in your area.\\nElderly = You are considered elderly if you are 62 years or over.\\nHandicapped = People with physical disabilities are considered handicapped.\\nMaster Deed = The master deed is a document that includes a statement that the\\nowner has converted the property in question into condominiums. It includes a\\ndescription of the land on which the building or buildings are located; a\\ndescription of the building; a set of plans showing the layout; a statement of the\\npurpose of each building and unit, including restrictions on use; the method by\\nwhich the master deed may be amended; the name and mailing address of the\\nmanagement agent; a statement that by-laws have been enacted; and the name of\\nthe lessor of each lease. A master deed must be recorded in the registry of deeds\\nor land registration office where the real estate is located.7\\nNotice of Conversion = A notice that the apartment is being converted to the\\ncondominium or cooperative form of ownership. This triggers the tenant having\\nan opportunity to purchase the unit. This notice can be accompanied by a notice to\\nvacate, if the plan is to displace the tenant if the tenant does not purchase the unit.\\nOr this notice may stand alone, if there is no current plan to displace the tenant if\\nthe tenant does not purchase the unit.\\nNotice to Vacate = A notice that the tenant will be required to leave the apartment\\nin order to facilitate the conversion of the property to condominiums or\\ncooperatives and/or to facilitate the sale of a condominium or cooperative unit.\\nAny notice to vacate must be accompanied by information about the tenant’s\\nrights to an extended notice period, rent and eviction protections during the notice\\nperiod, and to relocation payments.\\nChapter 17: Condominium Control ▲\\n\\nProtections for Tenants Under the\\nState Condo Law\\nIn 1983, the legislature passed a statewide condominium and cooperative\\nconversion eviction law, providing certain basic protections for tenants in\\nMassachusetts.8 The state condo law provides that in most situations a\\nlandlord who wants to convert her rental units to condominiums or a\\ncooperative must provide every tenant with the following protections:9\\n\\uf0a7 Proper notice of any condo conversion eviction,\\n\\uf0a7 The right of \"first refusal\"\\nto buy the apartment,\\n\\uf0a7 Rent protections, and\\n\\uf0a7 The right to moving expenses.\\nThe state condo law covers all types of housing except:\\n\\uf0a7 Public housing,\\n\\uf0a7 Buildings with 3 or less units where the owner lives in one of the units\\n(as of August 2024)\\n\\uf0a7 Rooming houses occupied by residents who stay less than 14 days, and\\n\\uf0a7 Any building that has not been used for residential purposes for at least\\none year prior to an owner’s filing a master deed for a condo\\nconversion.\\nIn addition to the statewide condo law, the following communities have\\nadopted local condo ordinances, providing tenants with greater or different\\nprotections:\\n\\uf0a7 Abington \\uf0a7 New Bedford\\n\\uf0a7 Amherst \\uf0a7 Newburyport\\n\\uf0a7 Boston \\uf0a7 Newton\\n\\uf0a7 Brookline \\uf0a7 Salem\\n\\uf0a7 Lexington \\uf0a7 Somerville\\n\\uf0a7 Marlborough\\nIf you live in any of the above communities, your local condo law applies\\nto you and the state condo law does not (although certain statewide\\nprotections cannot be altered). Included in this chapter is a brief explanation\\n▲ Chapter 17: Condominium Control\\n\\nabout each of these local ordinances. To get a copy of your local condo law,\\ncontact your local town or city hall.\\nUntil recently, the state law (and most local laws relying on the state law)\\ndid not provide any protections for conversions of properties with 3 or\\nfewer units. (Somerville is an exception and is discussed further below.) But\\nas of August 2024, condo conversion tenant protections now apply to non-\\nowner-occupied properties of 3 or fewer units. If you are a tenant in an\\nowner-occupied building with 3 or fewer units that is converting to condos\\nyou are still protected by regular landlord-tenant law, your lease, or any\\nsubsidy or use restrictions on the property.\\nNote: The statewide condo law and local condo ordinances based on\\nthe statewide law were not affected by the abolition of rent control-\\nrelated regulation in 1994.10\\n1. Proper Notice of Condo Conversion\\nEviction\\nIf your landlord wants you to move to allow conversion of the apartments in\\nyour building into condominiums or a cooperative, or for sale and occupancy\\nby others, the landlord must send you a written notice at least 1 year before\\nthey want you to move out. If you are a low- or moderate-income tenant or\\nthere is an elderly or disabled person in your household, your landlord must\\ngive you 2 years\\' notice before they want you out.11 In addition, if you are\\nelderly, disabled, or low- or moderate-income tenant, the landlord must help\\nyou find a new apartment. This apartment must be in the same town where\\nyou now live and must be comparable to your current apartment and have the\\nsame rent. If your landlord does not find you a comparable apartment, you\\nare entitled to up to an additional two years to stay in your current unit while\\nyou find alternative housing.12\\nIf your landlord has given notice of plans to convert your unit, or other intent\\nto convert, any subsequent eviction may be considered a condo conversion\\neviction subject to the notice, extension, rent, and relocation benefit\\nprotections in the state law. Thus, any no fault eviction is suspect. However,\\nan eviction for non-payment of rent or a lease violation is not considered a\\ncondo conversion eviction.13\\nA condo conversion notice does not mean that you have to automatically\\nmove out of your apartment. The purpose of this notice is to legally terminate\\nyour tenancy. To move you out, your landlord must file an eviction case in\\ncourt and a judge must give your landlord permission to evict you. Unless a\\njudge gives your landlord permission to evict you, you do not have to\\nmove out of your apartment. In addition, the court may give you\\nadditional time to relocate.14\\nChapter 17: Condominium Control ▲\\n\\nA condo conversion notice must be hand-delivered to you or sent by certified\\nmail. The notice must include a statement of your rights.\\nIf You Have a Lease: If you have a lease and the term of your lease\\nends after the date on the condo conversion notice, your landlord\\ncannot force you out before the date on your lease. If they do, you\\nmay have legal defenses or counterclaims that you can use to prevent\\nor delay your eviction. For example, if the notice your landlord sent\\nyou was improper, a judge should dismiss your eviction case. For\\ninformation about what your rights are during the eviction process\\nand how to fight an eviction, see Chapter 12: Evictions.\\nIf you decide to move out before the date on the notice of a conversion, you\\nmay be entitled to moving expenses. Make sure to give your landlord proper\\nnotice that you are moving out. See the section in this chapter called Moving\\nExpenses and Chapter 11: Moving Out.\\n2. Right to Purchase\\nUnder the state condo law, when a landlord gives you notice of conversion,\\nthey must also offer you the first right to purchase your unit.15 This is called a\\n\"right of first refusal.\"16 The landlord must do this by including with the\\ncondo conversion notice a document called a \"purchase and sale agreement.\"\\nThis document will tell you how much the landlord wants to sell the unit for\\nonce it is converted into a condo. If you want and can afford to buy the\\napartment, you have 90 days to negotiate a purchase price with the landlord.\\nDuring this 90-day period, the landlord cannot offer to sell the unit to anyone\\nelse.17\\nIf you do not want to buy the unit or cannot afford to buy it, the landlord can\\nsell the unit on the open market after the 90-day period has passed.18 Any\\nperson or entity buying your unit will then become your new landlord. This\\nnew landlord must follow all the provisions of the state condo law and must\\nhonor your right to remain in your apartment until the expiration of your\\nlease. (In cases where the landlord gave you both a notice of the right to\\npurchase and a notice to vacate in case you did not purchase, the new\\nlandlord must honor your right to remain for the notice period, subject to any\\nextensions that may otherwise apply under the condo conversion law.)\\nSometimes there has been some confusion between rights to purchase and\\nother condo conversion rights. It may be that an owner wishes to sell a unit as\\na condo but does not intend to displace the tenant if the tenant does not\\npurchase the unit. In such cases, the tenant should get notice of the right to\\npurchase separate from other condo conversion rights. If, subsequently, there\\nis a decision by the owner to displace the tenant to facilitate a sale of a condo\\nunit, the tenant should then get the extended notice of displacement,\\nrelocation rights, and lease and rent protections that are part of the law.19\\n▲ Chapter 17: Condominium Control\\n\\n3. Rent Protections\\nIf you receive notice of a condo conversion eviction, the law controls how\\nmuch your landlord can increase your rent during the notice period (and any\\nextension).20 The owner of the building or any subsequent owner of your\\ncondo cannot increase your rent by more than 10% per year or the increase in\\nthe Consumer Price Index the year before your landlord gave you notice,\\nwhichever is less.21 This applies to tenants with or without leases. For\\nexample, if your landlord gave you notice that your apartment was being\\nconverted to a condo in 2024, and the increase in the Consumer Price Index\\nwas 3.0% in June 2024, your rent could not be raised more than 3.0%.22\\nIf you have a written lease, your landlord cannot raise your rent until the\\nlease expires. The one exception is that the landlord can increase the amount\\nof rent as described in the previous paragraph if you have what is called a\\n\"tax escalator clause\" in your lease. If your lease has a tax escalator clause,\\nyour landlord may be able to raise the rent before the lease expires if the\\nproperty taxes go up.23 See Chapter 5: Rent for more information about tax\\nescalator clauses.\\nIf you have a written lease, the landlord must also renew your lease for\\nhowever long you are allowed to remain in your apartment under the condo\\nconversion eviction notice (or any extension provided by law). For example,\\nif you had a lease that expired September 1, 2024, and the landlord gave you\\none-year notice of condo conversion in February 2024, the landlord would\\nhave to extend your lease on its original terms until February 2025.\\nTo avoid giving tenants proper notice of conversion or moving expenses,\\nsome landlords may attempt to raise rents before they actually file a master\\ndeed, thereby forcing existing tenants out. Under the law, however, the owner\\nmerely has to have an \"intent to convert\" in order for tenants to be protected\\nagainst rent increases.24\\n4. Moving Expenses\\nIf you get a notice to vacate for condo conversion, your landlord may have to\\npay a certain amount to cover your moving costs. A landlord must pay your\\nmoving expenses if:\\n\\uf0a7 You do not owe any rent, and\\n\\uf0a7 You voluntarily move out before the date on the notice to vacate\\n(subject to any extension required for elderly, disabled, or limited\\nincome tenants where the owner did not locate alternative comparable\\nhousing within the original notice period).\\nChapter 17: Condominium Control ▲\\n\\nYou are entitled to a maximum of $750. If you are an elderly, handicapped,\\nor low- or moderate-income tenant, you are entitled to a maximum of\\n$1,000.25 As discussed below, some local laws provide greater relocation\\nbenefits. You must document your actual moving expenses.\\nLocal Protections for Tenants Facing\\nCondo Conversion\\nThe state condo law allows towns and cities to adopt, by a 2/3rd vote of their\\nlocal legislative bodies, local ordinances or bylaws regulating condominium\\nconversion that are stronger than, or which otherwise differ from, the\\nstatewide law.26 To get a copy of your local ordinance or bylaw, contact\\nyour city or town hall. What follows are brief descriptions of each of the\\nlocal condo ordinances in Massachusetts.27\\n1. Abington\\nAbington has a local bylaw that requires owners or developers to obtain a\\npermit to convert an existing structure to condominium or cooperative\\nownership.28 The developer or owner must first give notice of the intent to\\nconvert to the tenants. This notice to tenants must be mailed by registered\\nmail, return receipt requested, set forth generally the tenants’ rights under the\\nbylaw, and include a copy of the bylaw.\\nAfter an owner or developer gives tenants the notice of intent to convert, they\\ncan then file an application for a permit to convert with the Town Clerk, who\\ngives the application to the Planning Board. The application must include a\\nfiling fee, copies of the notices of intent, and other items that may be required\\nby the Planning Board. The owner or developer must obtain a permit prior to\\nfiling the master deed.\\nThe Planning Board must then hold a public hearing within 60 days of the\\nfiling of the application. It must publish a notice of this hearing in the local\\npaper and send it by mail to the applicant, owners, and tenants. The Board\\nmust take final action on the permit application within 30 days of the public\\nhearing. If no action is taken, the permit is automatically considered granted.\\nA copy of the permit must be filed with the recorded master deed, and the\\napplicant must notify the Town Clerk within 10 days of recording the master\\ndeed. Permits expire if a master deed is not filed within 12 months of the\\nPlanning Board’s issuing the permit, and an 18-month period must pass\\nbefore another permit may be filed.\\nA condominium conversion permit must be granted if the Planning Board\\nfinds that the applicant has fully complied with the local bylaws. A permit\\nmay be denied if it is shown that tenants’ rights were violated prior to the\\napplication’s filing. The Planning Board may also revoke (take back) a\\n▲ Chapter 17: Condominium Control\\n\\npermit if five or more tenants petition the Board and show that tenants’ rights\\nhave been violated during the 12- or 24-month conversion notice period.\\nWithin 60 days of the filing of the master deed, the owner or developer must\\noffer to sell each unit to the tenant occupying the unit on terms and\\nconditions substantially the same as or more favorable than those in the state\\ncondo law. See Protections for Tenants under the State Condo Law in this\\nchapter.\\nThe owner may not proceed with eviction within the 12-month period\\nfollowing the recording of the master deed, or within 24 months in the case\\nof low- to moderate-income, handicapped, or elderly tenants as defined in the\\nstate condo law. There is no explicit exception to these protections for other\\ntypes of eviction unrelated to condo conversion. There are no specific\\nadditional protections beyond what the state condo law provides in terms of\\nthe owner’s requirement to help low- and moderate-income, handicapped,\\nand elderly tenants find comparable housing, or to provide relocation\\nassistance.\\nDuring the conversion notice period, the owner has a right to enter the unit to\\ninspect, obtain data, or show the unit to prospective or actual workers or\\npurchasers. The owner must give 2 days advance notice and may only enter\\nat reasonable times and a tenant may not unreasonably withhold their consent\\nfor an owner to enter.\\nHarassment by the owner is barred. This includes unreasonable requests to\\nenter a unit, failure of the owner to make repairs in a timely and professional\\nmanner, imposition of unjustifiable increases in rent (as measured by the\\nstate condo law), failure to provide the tenant with essential services, and\\nverbal harassment or threats against the tenant.\\nThe definitions of “elderly” and “handicapped” in the Abington bylaws differ\\nfrom the state condo law: elders are persons age 60 or older, and handicapped\\nincludes people with mental disabilities.\\n2. Acton\\nIn 1981, Acton obtained special state enabling authority to regulate condo\\nconversion before the statewide law was passed. This authority was revised\\nin 1987.29 Since its condominium regulation was not based on rent control, it\\nshould not have been affected by the abolition of rent control-related laws in\\n1994.30\\nActon\\'s enabling law prohibits conversion or removal of certain types of\\nhousing as rental housing without a permit. Housing that requires a permit\\nincludes buildings with 6 units or more, or non-owner-occupied buildings\\nwith 5 units or more. Permits must be granted if:\\nChapter 17: Condominium Control ▲\\n\\n\\uf0a7 The owner has given proper notice to all tenants of periods to vacate,\\nrights of first refusal, relocation benefits, assistance in locating\\ncomparable housing, and appropriate provisions for extension of rental\\nagreements and rent limitations during the notice period. The notice\\nperiods, rights of first refusal, and relocation benefits are the same as\\nthose in the statewide law; and\\n\\uf0a7 The owner has provided certification from a registered engineer or\\narchitect that the units meet all applicable building and health codes.\\n3. Amherst\\nUnder Amherst’s bylaw, adopted in 1984, no condominium or cooperative\\nconversion is permitted unless a conversion permit has been obtained.31\\nPermits can be obtained only if either (a) the vacancy rate for rental units in\\nthe town is above 5%, or (b) prohibiting a conversion would constitute an\\nunconstitutional taking, which the Board of Selectmen must specifically\\ndetermine.\\nThe Board must consider a number of factors when deciding whether to grant\\nor deny a permit, including:\\n\\uf0a7 The impact of the proposed conversion on the tenants;\\n\\uf0a7 The availability of rental housing of comparable type, quality, and cost\\nin the town;\\n\\uf0a7 The ease or difficulty of the affected tenants in finding alternative\\nrental housing;\\n\\uf0a7 Any efforts to lessen the impact on the tenants (including guaranteed\\nrights to remain for fixed periods, payment of moving expenses and\\nother relocation costs, and securing of alternative housing);\\n\\uf0a7 The physical condition of the property, and the financial viability of\\nthe property if maintained as rental housing;\\n\\uf0a7 Whether the property (or units in it) is vacant, for how long, and why;\\nand\\n\\uf0a7 The age, financial status, and health of the affected tenants and the\\nlength of their tenancies.\\nAn application for a conversion permit must be accompanied by a written\\nplan setting out an orderly process for conversion, and a description of the\\ngoverning process by which the owners’ association or cooperative\\ncorporation shall operate during and after conversion. The Board of\\nSelectman may also condition the granting of a permit upon the owner’s\\n▲ Chapter 17: Condominium Control\\n\\nmaking special provisions for certain units and the tenants in those units. No\\npermit is to be granted unless an independent licensed engineer or architect\\ncertifies that the property meets all applicable building and health codes. The\\nBoard may enact regulations related to the procedure for conversion permits\\nand impose a reasonable filing fee.\\nTenants may not be evicted for the purpose of permitting renovation,\\nrehabilitation, or occupancy by purchasers for 9 months after an application\\nfor a conversion permit, or for 6 months after a permit is granted, whichever\\nis longer. Harassment is prohibited, as is the failure to make necessary repairs\\nor provide required services, or the seeking of unreasonable rent increases\\nduring the notice period. Tenants have the right of first refusal to purchase\\ntheir units. There is no provision beyond what the state condo law provides\\nfor longer notice periods, extensions of leases, or relocation benefits\\n(although the Board could include such conditions in its permit decision).\\n4. Boston\\nIn Boston, between 1979 and 1994, condominium conversion protections\\nwere provided under the city\\'s rent control laws.32 Initially, protections were\\nlimited to extended notice periods, right of first refusal, moving expenses,\\nand relocation assistance, similar to those ultimately adopted in the statewide\\nlaw.\\nBeginning in 1984, a condominium conversion eviction ban was established\\nfor elderly, disabled, and low- to moderate-income tenants. This was\\ngradually expanded to encompass more groups. Finally, in 1988, the city\\nestablished a general ban on condominium conversion evictions and required\\nthat owners seek removal permits to convert units to condominiums.33\\nIn 1994, rent control laws were abolished by a narrow statewide referendum\\nvote.34 After the expiration of transitional rent control protections in 1995-\\n1996, condo protections could no longer be based on rent control authority.35\\nAs a result of the efforts of housing advocates, Boston then adopted a local\\ncondo ordinance based on the authority in the statewide condo law.36 Early\\nefforts to adopt a local condo ordinance in 1995 and 1996, however, were\\ninvalidated by litigation filed by the Greater Boston Real Estate Board.37 In\\n1999, the Boston condo ordinance was finally adopted and currently remains\\nin effect.38\\nBoston\\'s law differs from the statewide law in the following respects:\\n\\uf0a7 There is a 5-year condo conversion eviction notice period for elderly,\\nhandicapped, or low- to moderate-income households, in comparison\\nto the statewide 2- to 4-year period.\\nChapter 17: Condominium Control ▲\\n\\n\\uf0a7 Boston’s ordinance includes people with mental disabilities in the\\ndefinition of “handicapped.”\\n\\uf0a7 The 5-year notice period is automatic, unlike the statewide law, which\\nrequires the tenant to show that the owner did not provide relocation\\nassistance in order to get an extension of up to 2 years on the original\\n2-year period.\\n\\uf0a7 The notice period applies to both new conversions and units already\\nconverted and occupied by elderly, disabled, or low- to-moderate-\\nincome tenants who previously had rent control protections against\\ncondominium conversion eviction.39\\n\\uf0a7 If an owner has given a condo conversion eviction notice, the tenant\\'s\\nlease is to be extended through the notice period and rent increases\\nthrough the notice period are limited to 10% per year or the annual\\npercentage increase in the Consumer Price Index, whichever is less.\\n\\uf0a7 The owner may evict the tenant only for \"just cause.\"\\n\\uf0a7 If a tenant is in a unit at the time of conversion and has not received a\\nnotice of a condo conversion eviction, any eviction is presumed to be a\\ncondo conversion eviction—unless the owner can show that this was\\nnot the case (for example, the owner simply wanted a higher rent, but\\nintends to keep the unit as rental housing).\\n\\uf0a7 Relocation benefits are substantially more than those under the\\nstatewide law ($10,000 for all tenants, and $15,000 for elderly,\\ndisabled, or low- to moderate-income tenants).40\\n\\uf0a7 There are two rights of first refusal: (i) at the time the property is first\\nconverted to condominiums or cooperatives, even if it is not the\\nowner\\'s intent at that time to displace the tenant; and (ii) any time the\\nowner intends to displace the tenant in order to facilitate sale or\\noccupancy of a condominium unit. The tenant is to be offered the unit\\non the same or better terms that are offered to third parties and to have\\na 90-day period to enter into a purchase and sale agreement.\\n\\uf0a7 Notice must be provided to the tenant in the tenant’s primary language\\nif that is not English.\\n\\uf0a7 Starting in 2021, owners must first present a conversion plan to the\\nCity\\'s Office of Housing Stability (OHS) for approval and then seek a\\nconversion permit from the City’s Inspectional Services Department\\n(ISD) prior to any condo or coop conversion. Past vacancies and any\\nthreats of displacement are investigated as part of this process. OHS is\\nto be given copies of various notices and affidavits from the owner to\\n▲ Chapter 17: Condominium Control\\n\\n41\\nmonitor compliance. If there is a dispute about whether a tenant is\\nlow- to moderate- income, elderly, or disabled and therefore entitled to\\nenhanced protections, either OHS or the courts, at the parties\\'\\npreference, can resolve the dispute. Other disputes are to be resolved\\nby the courts.\\n5. Brookline\\nUp until 2006, the status of condominium conversion controls in Brookline\\nwas unclear. In 1981, Brookline originally provided condo conversion\\nprotections under local rent and eviction control laws. Those provisions\\nended with the end of rent control in 1994-1996.\\nHowever, since 1981 Brookline also had a special condo conversion enabling\\nlaw separate from its rent control scheme. This local enabling law prohibited\\nany person from converting an apartment building or other multifamily\\ndwelling containing four or more residential units to a condominium without\\nfirst obtaining a special permit.42 Based on this, in 1986 Brookline adopted\\ntwo local bylaws regarding condo conversion and protection of tenants in\\nproperties not otherwise covered by its local rent control law.43 In 1994, the\\nstatewide law eliminating rent control explicitly referred to Brookline’s 1981\\ncondo law as one of the laws which was being abolished.44\\nIn 1998, Brookline revised its bylaws and eliminated any reference to rent\\ncontrol laws or to special income, age, or disability qualifications. The result\\nwas that special protections for elderly, disabled, and low- or moderate-\\nincome tenants were eliminated (including the right to longer notice periods\\nand to extension on those periods if comparable housing was not secured),\\nand relocation benefits were eliminated.\\nIn 2006, Brookline decided that its bylaws needed to be revised to provide\\ntenants with at least the same protections that they would have under the state\\ncondo law. The Board of Selectmen decided to refer solely to the state law\\nfor condominium conversion tenant protections. One difference, however,\\nbetween the Brookline bylaw and the state condo law is that Brookline’s\\nbylaws provide that within 48 hours of the recording of a master deed, the\\nowners must file a copy of the master deed with the Building Department,\\nwhich will then inspect the premises to confirm if they are in compliance\\nwith state and local codes.45\\nChapter 17: Condominium Control ▲\\n\\n6. Lexington\\nIn 1987, following the announcement that Emerson Gardens, the largest\\nrental housing development in Lexington, was facing condo conversion,\\nresidents and other supporters in the town passed a bylaw to create a condo\\nconversion permit system.46 The system is run by the Select Board of the\\ntown. It gives tenants in Lexington the following protections, in addition to\\nthose in the state condo law:\\n\\uf0a7 Eviction protections are provided for elderly, handicapped, and low- or\\nmoderate-income tenants for up to 5 years if the tenants can show a\\nhardship relating to matters such as finances, health, school, age, or\\nfamily problems, or the lack of suitable housing in Lexington.\\n\\uf0a7 All conversions and evictions must be licensed by the conversion\\nboard. Conditions may be imposed upon the granting of the license.\\nThe board may use the following factors in making that determination:\\n1. The protection of the public interest of the Town of Lexington,\\n2. The hardships imposed upon the tenants or the landlord,\\n3. The aggravation of the shortage of rental housing, and\\n4. The existence of reasonable accommodations to alleviate the\\nhardship.\\n\\uf0a7 The owner may be required by the town to sell up to 20% of the\\nconverted units to the Lexington Housing Authority for long-term\\naffordable units.\\n7. Marlborough\\nIn 1985, Marlborough adopted a condominium conversion ordinance as part\\nof its zoning bylaws. The ordinance was later amended.47 It covers buildings\\nthat have been used in whole or in part for residential purposes within one\\nyear prior to the conversion. The original law has several unique provisions:\\n\\uf0a7 No more than 25% of the housing accommodations in any building,\\nstructure or part of the building may be converted in any one calendar\\nyear.\\n\\uf0a7 Tenants’ right of purchase extends for a 6-month period from the date\\nof notice of the intent to convert.\\n\\uf0a7 The condo conversion eviction notice period is at least 3 years for all\\ntenants, and is 5 years for handicapped, elderly, or low- or moderate-\\nincome tenants. Moreover, this period for handicapped, elderly, or\\n▲ Chapter 17: Condominium Control\\n\\nlow- to moderate-income tenants can be extended for an additional 2\\nyears if the owner fails to find substitute comparable rental housing in\\nMarlborough at a similar rent.\\nProvisions on relocation benefits, extension of rental agreements and caps on\\nrent increases, and limitation on eviction are similar to those in the state\\ncondo law.\\nIn 2005, Marlborough provided that an owner could obtain a waiver from this\\nlaw, and that the provisions of the state condo law would apply instead,\\nprovided the following conditions were met:\\n\\uf0a7 The Mayor certified that the owner had paid $1,250 to the\\nMarlborough Affordable Housing Fund (or to such other fund for the\\nbenefit of affordable housing as may be designated by the City\\nCouncil) for each unit to be created as a result of the filing of the\\nmaster deed, with no more than 125 units being created by the owner.\\n\\uf0a7 The owner and the Executive Director of the Community\\nDevelopment Authority (CDA) (or other person or entity designated\\nby the City Council) signed a Monitoring Agreement, under which\\n70% of the units sold would be sold to those planning owner-\\noccupancy, and a bond of $500 times the number of units would be\\nheld to insure this condition was met within 3 years.\\n\\uf0a7 Tenants would be reimbursed for relocation expenses in accordance\\nwith the state condo law without any proof of actual moving or other\\nexpenses, as well as a “tenancy longevity bonus” equal to $250 for\\nevery year or fraction of an uncompleted year greater than two years\\nthat the tenancy was in existence as of the filing of the master deed.\\n\\uf0a7 The owner would pay the CDA or other entity $10,000 in advance as\\ncompensation for administering the Monitoring Agreement.\\n\\uf0a7 The owner provided the CDA or other entity with the condominium\\nbylaws to be recorded including the 70% owner-occupancy\\nrequirement to exist at all times, and that provision may not be deleted\\nor amended.\\n8. New Bedford\\n\\uf0a7 In 1988, New Bedford adopted a condominium conversion\\nordinance.48 The law differs from the state condo law in a few respects:\\n\\uf0a7 Elderly tenants are defined as those who are 59 years of age or older as\\nof the date of receipt of notice.\\nChapter 17: Condominium Control ▲\\n\\n\\uf0a7 Notices to the tenants must be in English, Spanish, and Portuguese,\\ninclude certain disclosures in “clear and conspicuous” language, and\\nbe given either in hand or by registered or certified mail.\\n\\uf0a7 A condominium review board monitors all conversions; verifies\\nincome, handicap, and elderly status; hears complaints about\\nviolations; and issues conversion permits. In addition, no permit is to\\nbe granted if, within the prior 12 months, the owner has taken any\\naction to circumvent the state or local condo law, including\\nunreasonable rent increases, reduction or elimination of services,\\ntermination of tenancy without cause, or the imposition of new\\nconditions of the tenancy.\\n9. Newburyport\\nThe Newburyport ordinance is intended to supplement the statewide law.49\\nThe ordinance expands the notice requirements: all tenants have a right to at\\nleast a 2-year notice of conversion; and elderly, handicapped, and low- or\\nmoderate-income tenants have a right to at least 4 years\\' notice of conversion.\\nIf there is a conflict between the Newburyport ordinance and the state law,\\nthe provisions that provide the strongest protections for tenants govern.\\nThe ordinance applies to buildings with 4 or more units. It does not apply to\\nrental housing constructed after October 31, 1988, the date the ordinance was\\nenacted. All future residential rental units converted to condominiums are\\nrequired to have new occupancy permits and new electrical inspections.\\n10. Newton\\nWhile Newton does not have any special condo law, it was granted special\\nstate enabling authority regarding condominium conversion in a very narrow\\ncontext.50\\nIf a special permit has to be obtained from the Board of Aldermen for use or\\ndevelopment of an apartment building, garden apartment building, or other\\nmulti-family dwelling containing 3 or more units, conversion to\\ncondominiums may not occur without obtaining an additional special permit\\nfrom the Board of Aldermen. Such a permit shall be granted only upon a\\nfinding that the public convenience is served by such a conversion and the\\npermit may contain such conditions and limitations necessary to protect\\ntenant rights as the Board deems reasonably necessary. However, this law\\ntook effect only if Newton accepted the grant of authority in 1974, and it is\\nnot clear that Newton ever did so.\\n▲ Chapter 17: Condominium Control\\n\\n11. Salem\\nIn November 2024, Salem obtained home rule authority to enact a\\ncondominium conversion ordinance for buildings containing two or more\\nresidential units.51 The scope is broader than the statewide condo law, even as\\namended earlier in 2024, as it can extend to owner-occupied 2- and 3-family\\nbuildings. The law allows investigations and hearings on conversions or\\nproposed conversion, a permit process, notification requirements, relocation\\ncosts, penalties for violations, and affords tenants and the City the right to\\npurchase the property offered for sale.\\n12. Somerville\\nIn 1980, Somerville passed a local ordinance requiring a removal permit for\\nthe conversion of rental units to condominiums. Because there was a question\\nas to whether Somerville had the authority to enact this ordinance, in 1985\\nthe City sought and obtained state legislation allowing it to regulate\\ncondominium conversions.52 This enabling legislation gave Somerville the\\nauthority to regulate condominium conversion more broadly than allowed\\nunder the state condominium conversion law. Somerville then re-enacted its\\nordinance (with some revisions) in 1985. Because of these enabling laws,\\nSomerville could cover buildings with less than 4 units despite the limits on\\ncoverage in the state-wide law in effect until 2024.\\nIn 2019, Somerville adopted significant amendments to its condominium\\nconversion permit system, including enhanced relocation benefits and\\nreaching back to determine if vacancies were the result of improper\\ndisplacement.53 The 2019 ordinance was by and large left intact in a 2022\\nSuperior Court ruling.54 and was further amended in July 2023.Where the\\nlocal ordinance applies, an owner intending to convert must give notice to the\\ntenant 1 year prior to seeking to recover possession.55 An elderly,\\nhandicapped, or low- or moderate-income tenant56 must receive 5 years\\'\\ncondo conversion eviction notice (which may be extended up to 2 more years\\nif the owner does not find the tenant comparable housing).57 A tenant has a\\n120-day right to purchase following the receipt of the notice to convert (or\\n180 days if elderly, disabled, or low/moderate income).58 If the tenant fails to\\nmake an offer at the end of 120/180 days, the converter may not sell the\\ncondominium at a price that is more favorable than the one offered to the\\ntenant for the next 90 days. Tenants who do not purchase and move during\\nthe notice period have a right to relocation benefits These figures are\\nannually adjusted by the Consumer Price Index.59 For moves between\\nFebruary 1, 2024 and January 31, 2025, the relocation benefits are $7,333.61\\n(or $12,222.70 if elderly, disabled or low/moderate income). Check the city’s\\nwebsite for the current relocation payment amounts.\\nThere is a condo review board that holds hearings and enforces compliance\\nwith the ordinance.\\nChapter 17: Condominium Control ▲\\n\\nProtections for Tenants Living in\\nCondos\\nIn 1991, the legislature took a first step toward addressing the pressing needs\\nof condominium associations with financial problems and absentee condo\\nowners.60 The 1991 amendments to the state condominium law allow condo\\nassociations to collect rent from tenants in cases of prolonged delinquency by\\nunit owners.61 Tenants, in turn, are protected from retaliation by the absentee\\ndelinquent owner if they pay rent, or express an intent to pay rent, to the\\ncondo association.62\\nIn early 1993, the legislature adopted additional provisions intended to\\nprotect condo associations and tenants residing in condominium units where\\nunit owners were not fulfilling their responsibilities.63 The law gives condo\\nassociations a \"super-priority\" in being able to collect unpaid charges from\\nunit owners (such as unpaid common-area charges, replacement reserves, or\\nthe like). This makes it much less likely that there will be prolonged defaults\\nby unit owners.\\nUnder the law, the condo association must designate a person or entity to\\noversee maintenance and repair of common areas and give written notice to\\nall unit owners of this. When an owner rents to a tenant, the owner must also\\ndesignate a person to oversee maintenance and repairs in the unit. At the start\\nof a tenancy, the owner must notify the tenant and the condo association in\\nwriting of the name and phone number of the person responsible for\\nmaintenance of the unit, and also give the tenant written notice of the name\\nand phone number of the person responsible for common-area repairs.\\nSimilar written notice must be given when there is any change in the person\\nor entity responsible for repairs.64 Unit owners must also supply the condo\\nassociation with the name or names of any tenants or occupants of the unit,\\nother than persons who are visitors for less than 30 days.65\\nIt can still be very difficult for a tenant in a condo unit to get repairs related\\nto common areas done. This is because common-area repairs often require\\nconsent of the condo association. The bylaws for the condo association may\\noutline how such decisions are made. However, in the case of an emergency,\\nthe unit owner may make such repairs and then bill the condo association.66 A\\nunit owner cannot, however, avoid responsibility under the state Sanitary\\nCode for having a habitable unit because they must get approval from the\\ncondo association for common-area repairs.\\nThe law also gives a unit owner who sells to a nonprofit organization the\\nright to provide a nonprofit buyer with financial information about the condo\\nassociation.67 This indirectly benefits tenants because non-profits will then be\\nable to determine how they can best maintain a controlling interest over the\\ncondo and stabilize the property.\\n▲ Chapter 17: Condominium Control\\n\\nEndnotes\\nSpecial thank you to William Loon at De Novo Center for Justice and\\nHealing for his contributions to this chapter.\\n1. A condominium is defined as land or the lessee’s interest in any lease of land\\nsubmitted to the provisions of G.L. c. 183A, including the buildings, all other\\nimprovements and structures thereon, and all easements, rights, and appurtenances\\nbelonging thereto. G.L. c. 183A, §1. A cooperative, on the other hand, can either be\\nformed through a cooperative housing corporation as described in G.L. c. 157B, or\\nmay be a unit in some other housing cooperative organized under G.L. c. 156B or\\nG.L. c. 157. Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983, Section 3 (approved November 30,\\n1983) (definitions of “condominium unit” and “cooperative unit”). While the laws\\ndiscussed here apply to both condominium and cooperative conversions, because\\ncooperative conversions are so rare, throughout this chapter the term condo\\nconversion, rather than condominium and cooperative conversion, is used.\\n2. See report commissioned by the Boston Redevelopment Authority and authored by\\nPatrick Dober, House of Cards: Absentee-Owned Condominiums and\\nNeighborhood Instability (March 1991).\\n3. The Legislature also prohibited condominium conversion in rental housing created\\nas part of a G.L. c. 121A urban renewal development, through the life of the G.L. c.\\n121A agreement. See G.L. c. 121A, §18D. Moreover, while cooperative conversion\\nis not banned in a G.L. c. 121A development, it is a fundamental change that would\\nrequire approval of the urban renewal agency.

Section 57 of Chapter 150 of the Acts of 2024 amended clause (iii) of the definition\\nof “housing accommodation” in St. 1987, c. 527, Section 3. The definition\\npreviously excluded buildings of less than four units. The revised definition limited\\nthe exclusion to owner-occupied buildings with less than four units. This section\\nwent into effect August 6, 2024, the date of enactment, based on the emergency\\npreamble to Chapter 150.\\n6. On occasion, communities with local condo laws have used slightly different\\ndefinitions for these terms. These are described in the discussion about such local\\nlaws.\\n7. Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983, Section 3 (approved November 30, 1983)\\n(defining “low or moderate income,” “elderly,” and “handicapped”); G.L. c. 183A,\\n§§2 and 8 (defining “master deed”). Note that in the state condo law, Chapter 527\\nof the Acts of 1983, Section 3 (approved November 30, 1983) defines the term\\n“handicapped” as a person who is “physically handicapped” as defined in G.L. c.\\n22, §13A as of the date the notice is given. Persons who are not physically\\nhandicapped do not come within the statute’s protections, but may qualify for\\nprotection due to their low- or moderate-income status. Some local ordinances have\\nextended the protections to persons with other disabilities.\\nChapter 17: Condominium Control ▲\\n\\n8. Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983 (approved November 30, 1983). The text of the\\nrelevant sections of this chapter can be found in any compilation of the Acts of\\n1983 legislative session, and is also printed in the annotations in G.L. c. 183A, §1.\\nThis legislation grew out of efforts that began in 1978 with an ad hoc statewide\\ngroup of advocates and community activists called the Condominium Conversion\\nTask Force. Up until this point, local groups in each community had organized to\\ndeal only with their local housing and condominium problems. Several cities and\\ntowns adopted condominium conversion ordinances, only to have them invalidated\\nby the courts because home rule authority from the legislature was required. See\\nBannerman v. City of Fall River, 391 Mass. 328 (1984); CHR General, Inc. v. City\\nof Newton, 387 Mass. 351(1982). In the early 1980s, the Massachusetts Tenants\\nOrganization (MTO), formed partially as a response to the rental housing crisis\\n(which had been made worse by condominium conversion), helped build a solid\\nbase of support for condo legislation. MTO first pushed for a complete ban on\\nconversion, but could not get sufficient legislative support. Following the election\\nof Governor Michael Dukakis in 1982, new discussions began to evolve around a\\nmore modest local option bill, providing statewide minimum standards and giving\\neach community the authority to enact its own law to meet local needs. The\\nrationale for this approach was that each community had a different problem. Some\\nlocalities even wanted to encourage condominiums to build up the tax base. Other\\ncommunities wanted to protect the scarce supply of rental housing and prevent\\ndisplacement. In 1983, MTO and the real estate industry agreed to a bill that\\nprovided a minimum condominium conversion eviction notice standard for all\\nlocalities. Despite the fact that realtors reneged on this agreement at the last minute,\\nGovernor Dukakis worked closely with MTO and was successful in guiding\\nChapter 527 of the Acts of 1983 (approved November 30, 1983) through the\\nlegislature. The result was a victory for tenant organizing, even though tenants had\\nto abandon the notion of a condominium conversion ban.\\n9. The state condo law was subsequently amended in 1984 (making several technical\\nrevisions related to cooperatives), in 1989 (making a number of substantive changes\\nas recommended by the Attorney General\\'s office to clarify and improve\\nprotections), in 1990 (making clear that a locality\\'s or a local housing authority\\'s\\nright of first refusal could trump that of an individual tenant), and in 2024\\n(extending coverage to buildings with less than 4 units that were not owner-\\noccupied). See Chapter 170 of the Acts of 1984, Sections 4–5 (approved July 9,\\n1984); Chapter 709 of the Acts of 1989 (approved January 12, 1990); Chapter 520\\nof the Acts of 1990, Section 8 (approved January 2, 1991) ; Chapter 150 of the Acts\\nof 2024, Section 57 (approved August 6, 2024).\\n10.

Prior to the adoption of Chapter 527,\\nSection 2(d)(4) of the Uniform Summary Process Rules contained language that a\\nlandlord’s eviction filing must demonstrate compliance with any local condo\\nconversion eviction requirements, such as an affidavit that the eviction was not a\\ncondo conversion eviction or otherwise complied with condo conversion eviction\\nrequirements.

A right of first refusal is a discretionary agreement in which a party has an option to\\npurchase, usually for a definite time period. For instance, it could be written into a\\nlease that a tenant has the right to purchase for the first 30 days following receipt of\\nthe notice of intent to convert.\\n17. There is a limited exception to this if the city or town or the local housing authority\\nexercises any right of first refusal that it may have to purchase the unit for the\\npurpose of providing affordable housing. Such a right of first refusal can trump the\\ntenant\\'s right of first refusal.

The 1989\\namendments to Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983 (approved November 30, 1983), as\\nrecommended by the Attorney General\\'s office, made clear that tenants would not\\nlose protections because formal condo notices had not been given (such as where a\\ndeveloper tried to oust tenants through subterfuge). Instead, as long as it could be\\nshown through a variety of means that the owner had an \"intent to convert,\" this\\nwould be sufficient to trigger protections under the statewide law.\\n25.

Even if\\nlocal legislation is adopted, certain of the statewide baseline protections cannot be\\naltered. Thus, a city or town cannot extend protections to properties not covered by\\nthe statewide law, and additional protections for certain classes of properties—\\nhousing accommodations converted from non-housing to housing uses after\\nNovember 30, 1983, or which were constructed or substantially rehabilitated\\npursuant to any federal mortgage insurance program, without any interest subsidy or\\ntenant subsidy attached thereto, or financed through the Massachusetts Housing\\nFinance Agency, with an interest subsidy attached thereto—are prohibited.

When rent control was phased out in 1994-1996,\\nCambridge no longer had any basis for these protections. Cambridge has not yet\\nadopted a local condo ordinance under the authority of the statewide condo law.\\nAlthough an attempt was made in 2001 to pass a local ordinance, it did not obtain\\nthe necessary 2/3rds vote of the Cambridge City Council. Therefore, condo\\nconversion protections in Cambridge are the same as those under the statewide law.\\nHaverhill also had a condominium conversion ordinance in the past. Haverhill,\\nMass., Ordinances, c. 255 § 255 99A (2016). The condominium conversion permit\\nsystem that had been established in 1985, however, was left out of the Haverhill\\nZoning ordinance (Chapter 255) when that law was overhauled in 2020. Similarly,\\nMalden had eviction protections for tenants facing condominium conversion and\\nhas strong rules presuming that a conversion was taking place when certain\\nconditions were met.

See Greater Boston Real Estate Board v. City of Boston (\"GBREB\\nI\"), 397 Mass. 870 (1986). Boston subsequently obtained additional home rule\\nauthority allowing it to regulate the conversion of apartments to condominiums. See\\nChapter 45 of the Acts of 1987 (approved May 6, 1987).\\n34.

Similarly,\\nthe Boston Housing Court found that Boston might be able to provide protections\\nunder Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983 (approved November 30, 1983), as rent\\ncontrol protections ended. See Greater Boston Real Estate Board v. Boston Rent\\nEquity Board, Boston Housing Court, 95-CV-00475 (Daher, C.J., June 26, 1995).\\n“Moreover, the City and the Rent Board retain their authority to continue to regulate\\ncondominium conversions.

In Greater Boston Real Estate Board v. City of Boston, Boston Housing Court, 96-\\nCV-0087 (Daher, C.J., Feb. 1, 1996), the Housing Court indicated that an ordinance\\nChapter 17: Condominium Control ▲\\n\\nadopted by the city in late 1995 (Chapter 9 of the Ordinances of 1995 of the City of\\nBoston) might be invalidated on vagueness grounds. The City then withdrew that\\nordinance and adopted another in the spring of 1996 (Chapter 3 of the Ordinances\\nof 1996 of the City of Boston). This ordinance was invalidated by the Housing\\nCourt (see Greater Boston Real Estate Board v. City of Boston, Boston Housing\\nCourt, 96-CV-00752 (Daher, C.J., Nov., 22, 1996)), and subsequently by the\\nSupreme Judicial Court, because it extended protections to tenants who had moved\\ninto condominium units after they had been converted. This was found to be beyond\\nthe authority granted by Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983 (approved November 30,\\n1983). The Supreme Judicial Court found that the remaining provisions of the\\nordinance could not be severed. See Greater Boston Real Estate Board v.

G.L. c. 186, §15D. Violators can be fined up to $300. See G.L. c. 93A, §1 et seq940 C.M.R. §3.17(3)(c). Failure to\\ncomply with this provision may make the lease voidable by the tenant. A party\\'s secret signature to a lease,\\nunrevealed to the other party, is not valid or binding. Henchey v. Rathbun, 224 Mass. 209, 211 (1916). As noted by E.\\nSchwartz, Lease Drafting in Massachusetts §1.9 (1961), the tenant\\'s signature on a lease is an offer that dies if the\\nlandlord doesn\\'t sign within a reasonable period, but the tenant is bound as a tenant at will by signing.\\n2.

This is\\nnot required, however, if the manager or agent lives in the building.

Failure to do\\nso can result in a fine of up to $50 per day.\\n5. 940 C.M.R. §3.17(3)(a)(3).

G.L. c. 186, §15B(1)(c). If a lease clause requires a penalty before you are more than 30 days late, it is void and your\\nlandlord cannot collect under it even if you are more than 30 days late in paying your rent. You may not be charged\\nfor service of a notice to quit based on non-payment of rent Commonwealth v. Chatham Development Co., 49 Mass. App.\\nCt. 525 (2000) (landlord\\'s act of charging tenants a $25 dollar constable fee upon service of a 14-day notice to quit\\nfor nonpayment of rent, prior to the entry of a judgment in any eviction action, was a violation of G. L. c. 186, s.\\n15B(l)(c).\\n16 ▲ Chapter 1: Before You Move In\\n\\n14. The Boston Housing Court has noted that such a discount clause \"appears to be, in substance, a late fee charge\\nwhich is prohibited by G.L. c. 186, §15B(1)(c).\" Patriquin v.

G.L. c. 186, §15B(1)(c), which says that \"no lease . . . shall impose any interest or penalty for failure to pay rent until\\nthirty days after such rent shall have been due.\"\\n16. This clause describes two types of obligations you may have to a landlord after you leave an apartment. One is\\ncalled \"damages.\" This means that as soon as you leave, the landlord may sue you for the difference between the\\nrent you agreed to pay for the remainder of the lease and the \"fair rental value\" of the apartment. The other type of\\nobligation is called \"indemnification.\" This means that at the end of a lease, a landlord may be able to sue a tenant\\nfor the amount of money the landlord has lost because the tenant has left. Generally, the landlord cannot sue on\\nboth grounds—damages and indemnification. Gardiner v. Parsons, 224 Mass. 347, 350 (1916); Cotting v. Hooper, Lewis\\nand Co., 220 Mass. 273, 274 (1915). The landlord\\'s choice in this matter is critical, for it determines when one can\\nbring suit. Commissioner of Ins. v. Massachusetts Accident Co., 310 Mass. 769, 772 (1942); Hermitage Co. v. Levine, 248 N.Y.\\n333, 337 (1928) (Cardozo, C. J.). A landlord must also use \"reasonable efforts\" to find a new tenant to keep down\\nher losses due to having the apartment empty. Also, if a lease states that a landlord can recover attorney\\'s fees if she\\nsues a tenant for breaking a lease, state law says that a tenant can also recover attorney\\'s fees if a tenant sues a\\nlandlord and wins the case, even if the lease does not provide for this. G.L. c. 186, §20. Public and subsidized\\nhousing tenants may not be charged court costs or attorney\\'s fees unless there is an actual judgment from the court.\\nSpringfield Housing Auth. v. Oldham-King, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 935, 935 (1981) (rescript).\\n17. Krasne v.Tedeschi and Grasso, 436 Mass. 103, 109 (2002), Baldacci v. Copley Management, 32 Mass L. Rptr 391 (November\\n3, 2014).\\n18. G.L. c. 186, §15.\\n19. G.L. c. 186, §12. Waiver of notice to terminate tenancy in a lease is void. G.L. c. 186, §15A. The landlord has the\\nburden of showing that the tenant actually received the notice to quit, Ryan v. Sylvester, 358 Mass. 18, 19 (1970).\\n20. 940 C.M.R. §3.17(3)(b)(2).\\n21. 940 C.M.R. §3.17(2)(b).\\n22. You have a legal argument that your landlord has waived this clause of the lease. You should check your lease,\\nhowever, to see if there is a clause preventing waivers. You can also argue that having a pet is not a serious breach\\nof the lease. See Allen Park Assocs. v. Lewandowski, Hampden Housing Court, 89-SP9400, p. 7 (Abrashkin, J., May 8,\\n1989), where the judge found that management\\'s employees knew that the tenant had a dog, and therefore\\nmanagement had acquiesced in the dog\\'s presence and had waived its right to evict under the no-pet clause of the\\nlease.\\n23. 105 C.M.R. §410.010(a); 940 C.M.R. §3.17(1).\\n24. G.L. c. 186, §15B(4)(iii) and (6)(e).\\n25. The measure of damages is stated as the reasonable cost to the landlord to put the premises in the required\\ncondition. Corbett v. Derman Shoe Co., 338 Mass. 405, 414 (1958); Ryan v. Boston Housing Auth., 322 Mass. 299, 302\\n(1948). See Weeks v. Wilhelm-Dexter Co., 220 Mass. 589, 592 (1915). A landlord may be able to bring a separate court\\ncase for damages actually caused by the tenant, even if the landlord has violated the security deposit law. See also\\nJinwala v. Bizzaro, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 7 (1987).\\n26. G.L. c. 186, §15B(1)(a); 940 C.M.R. §3.17(6)(e).\\n27. A landlord need not act reasonably in withholding assent where a tenant must obtain assent in writing to sublet\\nunder a lease. Slavin v. Rent Control Board of Brookline, 406 Mass. 458, 463 (1990). However, a landlord cannot\\nunreasonably withhold consent if the lease says she can\\'t. Adams, Harkness, Hill, Inc. v. Northeast Realty Corp., 361\\nMass. 552, 557 (1972).\\nChapter 1: Before You Move In ▲ 17\\n\\n28. The landlord must bring a summary process action to evict you and is subject to civil and criminal penalties for\\nfailing to do so. G.L. c. 186, §§14, 15F; 940 C.M.R. §3.17(5). Summary process must be used to regain possession.\\nG.L. c. 184, §18 and G.L. c. 266, §120. The primary summary process statute is G.L. c. 239, §1.\\n29. In Massachusetts, the apparent powers of any agent are her real powers, and her actions are binding on her boss\\n(i.e., the landlord). Danforth v. Chandler, 237 Mass. 518, 520 (1921); Binkley Co. v. Eastern Tank, Inc., 831 F. 2d 333,\\n337 (1st Cir. 1987).\\n30. Verbal, or oral, evidence (as opposed to written) is admissible to establish the terms of a tenancy at will agreement.\\nWalker Ice Co. v. American Steel & Wire Co., 185 Mass. 463, 473 (1904). This is an exception to what is called the\\nparol evidence rule. Subsequent oral modification of a lease is admissible, but it must be supported by legal\\n\"consideration\" (which means that each party must give up something in order for the agreement to be binding).\\nCohen v. Homonoff, 311 Mass. 374, 376 (1942). A promise not to vacate premises is good consideration for an\\nadditional performance by the other party. Thus, if the tenant under a written lease threatens to move out, and the\\nlandlord, to please the tenant, agrees to reduce the rent or to provide additional services, such as heat, the landlord\\nis bound by her agreement if the tenant agrees not to move out. Commonwealth Investment Co. v. Fellsway Motor Mart,\\n294 Mass. 306, 313-14 (1936). See also Tashjian v. Karp, 277 Mass. 42, 46 (1931). Even without \"consideration,\" the\\nrefusal of the landlord to honor her promise is a violation of the Consumer Protection Act, G.L. c. 93A, §2. See 940\\nC.M.R. §§3.01, 3.05(1), 3.16.\\n31. If a landlord promises a tenant something and then denies that she made this promise, this may be a violation of the\\nConsumer Protection Act, G.L. c. 93A. Under G.L. c. 93A, it is against the law for a landlord or rental agent to\\nengage in deceptive acts or practices. To enforce the law, tenants should try to find witnesses other than themselves\\nto testify that the landlord made certain promises.\\n32. G.L. c. 186, §15B(1)(b).\\n33. For certain items, such as security deposits and last month\\'s rent, the landlord is required to give such a receipt.\\nG.L. c. 186, §15B(2)(a) and (3)(a).\\n34. Under G.L. 186, §15B(1)(b), the law is clear that a landlord can charge only first month\\'s rent, last month\\'s rent, a\\nsecurity deposit, and the cost of a new lock. Perry v. Equity Residential Management, LLC, U.S. District Court, District\\nof Massachusetts, Civil Action No. 12-10779-RWZ (August 26, 2014) (G.L. 186, §15B(1)(b) does not authorize\\nlandlords to charge prospective tenants an application fee, amenity fee, a community fee or an upfront pet fee);\\nBroad Street Associates v. Levine, Northeast Housing Court, 12-SP-2041 (Kerman, J., July 30, 2012) (landlord’s acts of\\ncharging an application fee and a recurring “pet fee” of $50 per month were both violations of G.L. 186,\\n§15B(1)(b)); Vazquez v.

While there is very little case law directly addressing this issue, if there is no reason for the pet rental fee other than\\nto protect the landlord against damage caused by the pet, a court may conclude that such a fee is illegal, at least to\\nthe extent that the landlord has collected a security deposit equal to the first months\\' rent.

In doing so, the court notes that a tenant has contractual rights\\narising out of the landlord\\'s breach of warranty, including the right to rescind the lease from the time when the\\nwarranty of habitability was first breached.\\n4. G.L. c. 111, §127L, often referred to as the Repair and Deduct Statute, also provides for the tenant to void the lease\\nas an alternative to making the repairs and deducting the cost from the rent. The following conditions must be met:\\n1) Inspection by the Board of Health;\\n2) Existence of conditions that endanger or materially impair the health, safety or well-being of the tenants; and\\n3) Failure of landlord to begin making the repairs or to arrange in writing to have them made within five days or failure to\\nsubstantially complete all necessary repairs within 14 days of the notice.\\n5. G.L. c. 111, §127L (the landlord must \"begin all necessary repairs or … contract in writing with a third party for\\nsuch repairs within five days after such notice, and … substantially complete all necessary repairs within fourteen\\ndays after such notice, unless a board of health, local code enforcement agency or court has ordered that said\\nviolations be corrected within a shorter period, in which case said period shall govern ….\")\\n6.

Your lease might have a clause saying that you are responsible for all of the rent for the lease term even after you\\nleave. However, if you do leave after the landlord gives you a notice to quit, your risk is limited for a few reasons.\\nFirst, your landlord has a duty to mitigate, or limit, her damages (see endnote 5, above), and therefore must find\\nanother tenant after you leave. Second, most judges in housing courts will not hold a tenant responsible for the rent\\nafter the landlord has terminated the tenancy by giving her a notice to quit. Third, in order to try to collect the rent,\\nthe landlord must sue you, and she may not want to take the time and energy to do so. Finally, even if the landlord\\ndoes win a judgment for the rent, if the tenant is on welfare or Social Security, the landlord cannot collect the\\njudgment from these payments.\\n9. Williams v.

G.L. c. 139, §19.\\n3. G.L. c. 139, §19.\\n4. Your landlord may not have to give you a notice to quit if she is claiming that you used your home for certain illegal\\nactivities. G.L. c. 139, §19. She must still bring you to court for a hearing before moving you out.\\n5. Lockouts are prohibited by G.L. c. 186, §§14 and 15F and G.L. c. 184, §18. They are also prohibited by the\\nAttorney General\\'s Consumer Protection Regulations, 940 C.M.R. §3.17(5). Under G.L. c. 186, §§14 and 15F, a\\nlandlord may be liable for triple damages or 3 months\\' rent (whichever is greater) plus costs and attorney\\'s fees for a\\nlockout. Lockouts are also a criminal offense under G.L. c. 186, §14. However, if a co-tenant has sought a lock\\nchange from the landlord for safety reasons under G.L. c. 186, §27, or if someone in your home has obtained a\\nrestraining order under G.L. c 209A which vacates you from the home, you could be legally barred from returning\\neven if you landlord hasn’t evicted you yet.\\n6. G.L. c. 186, §14.\\n7. G.L. c. 186, §14.\\n8. G.L. c. 239, §2A.\\n9. Manzaro v. McCann, 401 Mass. 880 (1988). The owner\\'s retaliatory actions are not the basis for a lawsuit or\\ncounterclaim unless the tenant\\'s complaints are in writing. Therefore, oral complaints to the owner cannot be the\\nbasis for retaliation.\\n10. G.L. c. 239, §8A.\\n11. An Act Relative to Housing Rights For Victims of Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Stalking:\\n\\uf075 Allows Victims to Break a lease for safety reasons: G.L. c. 186, §24 allows a tenant or co-tenant to terminate a\\nrental agreement and quit the premises upon written notification to the owner if a member of the household is a\\nvictim of domestic violence, rape, sexual assault, or stalking. Notification must be made within 3 months of the\\nmost recent violence or the tenant can terminate the rental agreement if a member of a tenant\\'s household is\\nreasonably in fear of imminent serious physical harm.\\n\\uf075 Bars discrimination against prospective tenants because they have sought the protection of this law: G.L.\\nc. 186, §25 provides that an owner shall not refuse to enter into a rental agreement, nor shall a housing provider\\ndeny assistance, based upon an applicant having terminated a tenancy under G.L. c. 186, §24 or requested a lock\\nchange under G.L. c. 186, §26.\\n\\uf075 Requires landlords to change the locks when required for safety reasons: G.L. c. 186, §26 provides that an\\nowner shall, upon the request of a tenant, co-tenant, or household member, change the locks if the tenant, co-\\ntenant, or household member reasonably believes that such individual is under an imminent threat of domestic\\nviolence, rape, sexual assault, or stalking.\\n\\uf075 Prohibits retaliation against tenants who seek protection against their abusers: The statute also explicitly\\namends G.L. c. 239, §2A to include, in “activity protected from reprisal,” taking action under G.L. c. 209A or G.L.\\nc. 258E, seeking relief under the new act, reporting to a police officer or law enforcement an incident of domestic\\nviolence, rape, sexual assault, or stalking, or reporting a violation of an abuse prevention or anti-harassment order.\\n12. To convince a court that a landlord is not retaliating against you, your landlord will have to show that she would\\nhave brought this eviction case against you at the same time and for the same reasons, whether or not you engaged\\nin the protected activities. See G.L. c. 186, §18 and G.L. c. 239, §2A. But see Xiaobing Xin v. King, 87 Mass. App. Ct.\\nChapter 12: Evictions ▲ 287\\n\\n1126 (2015) (Rule 1:28 decision) (where the court found that there is no presumption built in to the counterclaim\\nfor retaliation under G.L. c. 186, §18 where the tenancy has been terminated for nonpayment of rent.).\\n13.

G.L. c. 239, §1 provides that the landlord \"may recover possession\" through court procedures if, among other\\nthings, her tenant \"holds possession without right after the determination of a lease by its own limitation or by\\nnotice to quit or otherwise.\" The landlord does not have to give you a notice to quit if your lease has expired and\\nshe has not accepted any rent from you since the expiration of the lease, and she may not have to give you a notice\\nto quit if she is trying to evict you under G.L. c. 139, §19 for using your home for illegal activities.\\n16. Moylan v. Williams, Boston Housing Ct., No. 09-SP-5006 (Muirhead, J., Jan. 12, 2010) (action dismissed despite\\nfailure to pay rent because notice to quit did not state such failure was grounds for notice); Brown-Carriere v. Moore,\\nBoston Housing Ct., No. 14-SP-1267 (Muirhead, J, May 20, 2014) (where grounds in notice to quit and complaint\\nwere inconsistent, action must be dismissed).\\n17. The court can dismiss the eviction if the notice to quit gives the wrong address or does not clearly identify the\\nportion of the property involved, particularly if there is no proof that it was served at the correct address. See Media\\nv. Diaz, Boston Housing Ct., No. 14-SP-4345, (Muirhead, J., Nov. 20, 2014); Jones v. Leach, Boston Housing Court\\nNo. 10-SP-4586 (Muirhead, J., Dec. 29, 2010); Dixon v.

Espino, Boston Housing Court, No. 07-SP-2157 (Muirhead, J., June 28, 2007).\\nAnd: If the landlord’s notice to quit has not terminated the tenancy of every individual who may have a tenancy\\ninterest, the action may be dismissed. See, e.g., Hobbs v. Dixon, Boston Housing Court, No. 07-SP-2071 (Muirhead,\\nJ., June 20, 2007); Santana v.

Similarly, every individual with a\\ntenancy interest should be named in the proceeding. Otherwise, there may be a motion to dismiss for failure to join\\na necessary party. See sample Motion to Dismiss, Form 20.\\n18. Ashkenazy v. O\\'Neill, 267 Mass. 143, 145 (1929) held that a notice left with the tenant\\'s spouse \"would furnish\\npresumptive evidence that the defendant received the notice.\" It may be possible to rebut the presumption that the\\nnotice was actually received.\\n19. If you claim you did not get the notice, your landlord cannot rely merely on the fact that a constable left it at your\\nlast and usual place of abode. Ryan v. Sylvester, 358 Mass. 18 (1970). See also Bakis v. Mroue, Boston Housing Court,\\n07-SP-1679 (Muirhead, J., May 23, 2007); Beacon v. Doe, Boston Housing Court, 03-2551 (Winik, J., July 15, 2003).\\n20.

If you have a lease, although a notice to quit does not have to inform you of your right to cure, a judge may dismiss\\nan eviction case if a landlord sends a notice that misstates your right to cure. Springfield II Investors v. Anita Marchena,\\nHampden Housing Court, 89-SP-1342-S (Abrashkin, J., Jan. 4, 1999). In Springfield, the court dismissed a summary\\nprocess action brought against a tenant under a lease for non-payment of rent where the landlord served the tenant\\nwith a notice to quit that contained right to cure language appropriate to a tenancy at will (i.e., one cure as of right in\\na 12-month period and tender of cure required within 10 days of receipt of the notice). The tenant did not claim\\nthat she was misled or prejudiced by the failure to provide the cure rights under G.L. c. 186, §11 for lease tenancies.\\nCiting Oakes v. Munroe, 62 Mass. 282 (1851) and Maguire v. Haddad, 325 Mass. 590 (1950), the court noted that \"the\\nstandard applied . . . is not whether the tenant was misled to his prejudice but whether the notice conforms with the\\nstatute and is sufficiently clear, accurate, and certain so that it cannot reasonably be misunderstood.\" Based on this\\nstandard, the court held that the notice was facially defective and could not form the basis for a summary process\\naction.\\n288 ▲ Chapter 12: Evictions\\n\\n23. G.L. c. 186, §12.\\n24. A claim for rent at the higher amount may also be an unfair or deceptive practice in violation of the Consumer\\nProtection Act, G.L. c. 93A. See Small d/b/a The Apartment Co. v. Gonzales, et al., Hampden Housing Court, SP-6412-\\nS-85 (Peck, Jr., J., July 29, 1985).\\n25. Williams v. Seder, 306 Mass. 134, 137 (1940).\\n26. Your landlord is allowed to file an eviction in court up to 30 days before the end of your lease if your lease covers a\\nperiod of at least 6 months. G.L. c. 239, §1A. (This provision was passed at the insistence of landlords with seasonal\\nrentals who feared that the other provisions of the law that outlawed self-help evictions would make it harder for\\nthem to get rid of low-income tenants before the beginning of the high-rent season. But there is nothing explicit in\\nG.L. c. 239, §1A that limits its use to those situations.) A landlord must also show a court that there is a likelihood\\nyou will stay in the apartment beyond the end of your lease. If a court gives the landlord permission to evict you, the\\nlandlord cannot evict you until the day after your lease ends. Before that date, you have a right to ask a judge to\\ndelay the eviction. G.L. c. 239, §1A. See the section in this chapter called Delaying the Eviction.\\n27. English v. Moore, Boston Housing Court, SP-43972 (Daher, C.J., July 10, 1987); Thomas v. Pelletier, Hampden Housing\\nCourt, SP2006-S87 (Abrashkin, J., May 23, 1987), citing McGuire v. Haddad, 325 Mass. 590 (1950). Similarly, a\\nlandlord should not be permitted to send both a rental period notice alleging tenant fault and a 14-day notice for\\nnon-payment of rent in the hope that she can preclude the tenant from raising conditions defenses under G.L. c.\\n239, §8A. See Nichiniello v. Akerly, Somerville Dist. Ct., CV-910 (Coven, J., Oct. 30, 1990) (by sending 14-day notice,\\nlandlord must forgo right to proceed on 30-day notice and may proceed solely on landlord\\'s non-payment claims,\\nthereby allowing tenant to raise G.L. c. 239, §8A defenses).\\n28. See Sukhorukova v. Farmer, Western Division Housing Court, No. 10-SP-2501 (Fields, J., July 19, 2010).\\n29. A notice to quit for nonpayment of rent that includes both rent due and late payment charges may be defective,\\nsince the late payment charges are not rent and cannot be pursued in a summary process action. See G.L. c. 239, § 2\\n(owner’s claims limited to those for possession and rent or use and occupancy); Deep v. Tatro, Western Housing\\nCourt, No. 08-SP-2658 (Fein, J., Nov. 17, 2008); see also Hackett v. Smith, Boston Housing Ct., No. 14-SP-1109\\n(Muirhead, J., Apr. 11, 2014) (finding that water usage and mailbox replacement fees could not serve as grounds for\\nterminating a tenancy when served as a notice to quit for nonpayment of rent). Moreover, late payment charges can\\nbe recovered only if there is a written agreement providing for them and the rent is more than 30 days overdue. See\\nG.L. c. 186, § 15B(1)(c); Harris v. Wilson, Boston Housing Ct., 09-SP-0177 (Muirhead, J., Jan. 28, 2009) (plaintiff not\\nentitled to late fees because there was no written agreement). The unlawful assessment of late payment charges may\\nlead to liability under G.L. c. 93A. See Halabi v. Suriel, Boston Housing Court, No. 09-SP-3931 (Muirhead, J.,\\nOct. 19, 2009).\\n30. G.L. c. 186, §12.\\n31. G.L. c. 186, §12.\\n32. If the owner fails to state the statutory cure rights within the 14-day notice to quit received by a tenant-at-will, the\\nstatute provides that the tenant’s opportunity to cure is extended to the answer date (without any requirement for\\ntendering interest or costs of suit). See, e.g., Olivier v. McFarlane, Boston Housing Court, No. 09-SP-0032\\n(Muirhead, J., Jan. 20, 2009) (lack of language in notice about cure rights affects not notice’s validity, but time for\\ntenant to cure; since tenant did cure prior to entry of action, eviction must be dismissed).\\n33.

Although, typically, rent is due on the first of each month, you and your landlord\\nmay have agreed on a different \"rent day.\" If there was no agreement on a specific rent day, the rent day is\\nconsidered to be the last day of the month. Connors v. Wick, 317 Mass. 628, 631 (1945). If a landlord files an eviction\\naction in court, it will be her burden to prove that the notice terminated your tenancy on a rent day. Connors v.

In Bennett v. Dean, Boston Housing Court, 27618 (Daher, C.J., Sept. 20, 1989), Chief Judge Daher held that the\\nstatute would be unconstitutional if it authorized evictions without any process of law, stating: \"This Court has to\\ninterpret G.L. c. 139, §19 in light of the present day constitutional requirement of due process. It was the\\nLegislature\\'s determination that anyone violating G.L. c. 139, §19, be deemed a trespasser. But an occupant has a\\nright to be heard before being deemed a trespasser. \\'The fundamental requisite of due process is the opportunity to\\nbe heard.\\'\" The general prohibition against self-help eviction found in G.L. c. 184, §18 provides further evidence\\nthat the landlord\\'s right of entry under G.L. c. 139, §19 does not include the right to forcibly eject the tenant\\nwithout court process. G.L. c. 184, §18 itself distinguishes \"entry\" from ejection. It prohibits a landlord\\'s entry\\n\"except in cases where his entry is allowed by law[,]\" but goes on to prohibit any \"attempt to recover possession of\\nland or tenements in any manner other than through an action brought pursuant to chapter two hundred and thirty-\\nnine [summary process] or such other proceedings authorized by law.\" Although it could be argued that G.L. c. 139,\\n§19 provides a case in which \"entry\" is allowed by law, the actual ejectment of a tenant cannot take place without\\ncourt process.\\n42. The statute, G.L. c. 139, §19, provides, in relevant part, that \"such use [of the apartment for illegal activity] shall, at\\nthe election of the lessor or owner, annul and make void the lease or other title under which such tenant or\\noccupant holds possession and, without any act of the lessor or owner shall cause the right of possession to revert\\nand vest in him, and the lessor or owner may seek an order requiring the tenant to vacate the premises or may avail\\nhimself of the remedy provided in chapter two hundred and thirty-nine.\"\\n43. In New Bedford Housing Authority v. Olan, 435 Mass. 364 (2001), the Supreme Judicial Court held that a public housing\\ntenant being evicted under G.L. c. 139, §19 has a right to a jury trial and to discovery.\\n44. Cases in which injunctions have been issued include: Morris v. Davis, Boston Housing Court, 05-00192 (Winik, J.,\\nApr. 6, 2005); Boston Housing Authority v. Coleman, Boston Housing Court, 99-CV-01130 (Daher, C.J., Nov. 22, 1999);\\nWingate Management Co., Inc. v. Pikovsky, Boston Housing Court, 29705 (Daher, C.J., Dec. 28, 1990) (issuing\\ninjunction against drug-dealing husband, but not his wife); Boston Housing Authority v. McDonald, Boston Housing\\nCourt, 24666 (Daher, C.J., Aug. 9, 1989); Reserve Realty Corp. v. Cooper, Boston Housing Court, 27243 (Daher, C.J.,\\nAug. 3, 1989) (enjoining tenant\\'s son from entering or residing at his father\\'s residence, but allowing father to retain\\ntenancy).\\nWhile it may be difficult to challenge the use of injunctions against specific individuals and for specific acts where\\nthe summary process laws are not sufficient to eliminate a danger to the community, many questions can be raised\\nabout the appropriate remedy in any specific case. Although in McDonald drugs were found in the tenant\\'s\\napartment, it was not clear from the record that the tenant was charged with a criminal offense. Her apartment was\\napparently being used by others. Advocates need to ask, if the tenant was not, in fact, dealing drugs, why was it\\nnecessary to obtain an emergency injunction against her and why wouldn\\'t the summary process procedure have\\nprovided the landlord with an adequate remedy? Injunctions can be granted only if certain requirements are met.\\nMost importantly, the landlord must be able to show that there is no other adequate legal remedy available to her.\\n290 ▲ Chapter 12: Evictions\\n\\nSee, e.g., Conlon v. Teamsters, 409 F. Supp. 1165, 1167 (D. Mass. 1976). Since the landlord can always use the ordinary\\neviction process, she should not be able to get an injunction unless she can show that the ordinary eviction process\\nis inadequate. In addition, the landlord must meet the other requirements for getting an injunction. In order to get\\nan injunction, the landlord must show:\\n1) Threat to the landlord of irreparable harm if the injunction is denied;\\n2) Landlord\\'s likelihood of success on the merits of the case;\\n3) That risk of harm to the landlord outweighs threatened harm to the defendant; and\\n4) That the public interest will be better served by issuing the injunction than by denying it.\\nSee Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. v. Cheney, 380 Mass. 609, 615-17 (1980).\\n45. The Hampden County Housing Court has held that evidence seized without a warrant may be suppressed in a civil\\naction.

Hollywood Park Assoc. v.\\nAnne Marie Diaz, Hampden Housing Court, 90-SP-0078-S (Abrashkin, J., Mar. 1, 1990).

In Reserve Realty, an owner\\nsought to have a tenant family declared trespassers under G.L. c. 139, §19, alleging that police seized 58 grams of\\ncocaine and $4,400 in cash from the son. The tenant father argued that he had no knowledge of his son\\'s activities\\nand that the family should not be penalized. The court allowed the family to stay but entered an injunction barring\\nthe son from the premises. See also Wingate Management Co., Inc. v. Pikovsky, Boston Housing Court, 29705 (Daher,\\nC.J., Dec. 28, 1990) (court issued permanent injunction against husband based on his drug activity but denied\\ninjunction against wife, finding that, although she knew about husband’s drug activity, she was not responsible for\\nhis illegal activity and was in fear of him).\\n47. See New Bedford Housing Authority v.

Jurisdiction in summary process is limited by statute to cases in which the defendant is in\\npossession of the premises \"unlawfully against the right of the plaintiff.\" G.L. c. 239, §2.

Whether a lease or a tenancy-at-will is involved, the grounds for eviction must be supported by the prior notice to\\nquit. See, e.g., Everett v.

The answer form included at the end of this book is generally more useful than the form supplied by the court\\nbecause it includes all of the most commonly used defenses and counterclaims and has complete instructions for its\\nuse.\\n88. If the court fails to notice the jury demand and neither party brings it to the court’s attention until after the trial is\\ncompleted or significantly underway, it may be deemed waived.

Where ongoing rent is not being paid or there is a significant arrearage, a landlord may request that the court enter\\nan order that rent in arrears be escrowed or paid into court and that the tenant be required to pay for current use\\nand occupancy pending the jury trial. If such an order is entered and the tenant does not comply, the court may\\norder that the right to jury trial is waived. See Chandler v. Johnson, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 1120 (2011) (Rule 1:28 opinion;\\ntext available at 2011 WL 103596); Wingate Mgmt. v. Taranov, Boston Housing Court, No. 08-SP-4466 (Muirhead, J.,\\nFeb. 20, 2009); Cushing Constr. Mgmt. v.

A report so signed is admissible in evidence without the need to have the inspector present, and is prima facie\\nevidence that the conditions stated in the report exist. G.L. c. 239, §8A. The Board of Health is required to provide\\nthis certification on every inspection report. 105 C.M.R. §410.821(A)(8). Note that where a landlord fails to appeal\\nan order of the Board of Health under the administrative appeal process set forth by the state Sanitary Code, the\\nBoard\\'s decision becomes final and the landlord is barred from collaterally attacking the decision in a subsequent\\ncourt action. Lezberg v. Rogers, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 1158 (1989).\\n103. Try to state these questions in a way that would require your landlord to answer in short (preferably \"yes\" or \"no\")\\nanswers that are helpful to your case. For example, if you are claiming that your landlord is evicting you because you\\ncalled the Board of Health, you might want to ask (among other things): \"You didn\\'t start this eviction until after I\\ncalled the Board of Health, did you?\" rather than \"Why are you evicting me?\"\\n104. You may require people to appear, testify, and bring evidence to court by using a subpoena. Mass. R. Civ. P. 45.\\nAnyone can serve a subpoena, but you must serve it according to state law.

If you have filed a motion to dismiss that is to be heard on the trial date, you should remind the judge of this.

No cases have specifically dealt with the definition of an \"occupant\" under the statute, but it\\napparently includes those who may not fit a strict definition of \"tenant.\"\\n117. A landlord who sends only a 14-day notice for non-payment of rent cannot rely on any allegations of tenant fault\\nsince she would have been required to send a 30-day notice for fault-based eviction. Kahaly v. Sinke, Roxbury\\nDistrict Court, 12164 (Martin, Jr., J., Nov. 25, 1987).\\n118. G.L. c. 239, §8A allows a tenant or occupant to base a defense or counterclaim on any claim against the landlord\\nthat relates to the property, rental, tenancy, or occupancy. It is therefore possible to defend against a non-payment\\nor no-fault eviction whenever your landlord has violated any term of your tenancy agreement, breached the\\nwarranty of habitability, or violated any relevant law or regulation. If the tenant\\'s defense or counterclaim is based\\non the condition of the premises or services provided, the tenant must comply with the specific requirements\\nspecified in G.L. c. 239, §8A.\\n119. G.L. c. 239, §8A, ¶3 makes inspection reports prima facie evidence that a defense and counterclaim exist.\\n120. G.L. c. 239, §8A.

G.L. c. 239, §8A.\\n123. G.L. c. 239, §2A as amended by St. 1978, c. 149. This amendment added the requirement that the presumption of\\nretaliation can be overcome only if the landlord presents \"clear and convincing evidence.\"\\nThe second part of this standard is often overlooked by the courts, but is very important, especially for tenants at\\nwill in a \"no-fault\" eviction, since it requires the landlord to prove a legitimate reason for the eviction. It is also\\nimportant in cases where the tenant is \"at fault.\" (For example, if your landlord claims that she is evicting you\\nbecause you have a pet in violation of your tenancy agreement, but your landlord has known about the pet for a\\nlong time and didn\\'t bring the eviction until you engaged in some protected activity, it would be very difficult for\\nher to overcome the presumption of retaliation because she could have previously evicted you for the given reason.)\\nSee Collin v. Eldridge, Worcester Superior Court, 28794 (Oct. 23, 1984); Michel v. Monfiston, Boston Housing Court, 06-\\nChapter 12: Evictions ▲ 295\\n\\nSP-1613 (Winik, J., June 21, 2006); Genovevo v.

Laiacona, 2014 Mass. App. Div. 141 (2014) (court finds that where the tenant made a complaint about poor\\nhousing conditions after receiving a 14 day notice to quit that tenant may not be entitled to a retaliation defense).\\nThe retaliation defense under G.L. c. 239, §2A applies to all eviction cases, including non-payment of rent cases.\\nCompare G.L. c. 186, §18 (sending notice to quit for non-payment of rent does not trigger presumption of\\nretaliation). You may be able to use this defense successfully in a non-payment case where the landlord sent a notice\\nto quit for non-payment shortly after your rent was due and within 6 months of your engaging in protected\\nactivities. Your claim would be stronger if your landlord usually waits a month or two for late rent before sending\\nnon-payment notices.\\n124. Stone Run East Assocs. v. McDonald and Harrison, Quincy District Court, E-88-0002, E-88-0003 (Sept. 19, 1988). In\\nStone Run, a handicapped tenant raised a discrimination defense in an eviction brought by a landlord because the\\ntenant allegedly interfered with the rights of other tenants and permitted unauthorized occupants to reside in the\\napartment in violation of the lease. The court rejected the landlord\\'s claim that G.L. c. 239, §8A precluded the\\ntenant\\'s defenses in a fault-based eviction, holding that \"the court cannot be in a position to assist a landlord in\\npursuing a discriminatory eviction. For purposes of this motion I must assume that there has been discrimination. If\\nthe defendant is able to establish that discrimination is the motive underlying the termination of the tenancy then it\\nshould be a bar to the action.\"\\n125. See Chapter 7: Discrimination, for citations to federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of\\nhandicap.\\n126. Discrimination, or failure to reasonably accommodate a tenant with a disability, may be raised as an affirmative\\ndefense to eviction and as a counterclaim. See Boston Hous. Auth. v.

G.L. c. 93A and the Attorney General\\'s regulations promulgated thereunder prohibit oppressive or unconscionable\\nacts and practices by landlords. This presumably includes insisting on terms that are oppressive or unconscionable.\\nIn Commonwealth v. DeCotis, 366 Mass. 234 (1974), the Supreme Judicial Court disallowed certain resale fees being\\ncharged by mobile home park owners. One of the standards used was the unconscionability provision of the\\nUniform Commercial Code (UCC): \"That provision of the Uniform Commercial Code which permits a court to\\nrefuse to enforce a contract or a contract provision which is unconscionable, provides a reasonable analogy here.\"\\nUCC, G.L. c. 106, §2-302(1), provides: \"If the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the\\ncontract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it\\nmay enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of\\nany unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.\" For an overview of this problem and arguments\\nsupporting the extension of the UCC, see Note, The Tenant as a Consumer, 3 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 59 (1971). For a case\\n296 ▲ Chapter 12: Evictions\\n\\nholding that a lease is a \"good\" under the UCC, see Silverman v. Alcoa Plaza Assocs., 37 App. Div. 2d 166, 323\\nN.Y.S.2d 39 (1971).\\nAnother approach is to analyze unfair leases or clauses as \"contracts of adhesion.\" Contracts of adhesion have been\\ndefined as \"agreements in which one party\\'s participation consists of his mere \\'adherence,\\' unwillingly and often\\nunknowingly, to a document drafted unilaterally and insisted upon by what is usually a powerful enterprise.\"\\nEhrenzweig, Adhesion Contracts in the Conflict of Laws, 53 Colum. L. Rev. 1072, 1075 (1953). The closest a\\nMassachusetts court has come to this view is to say that since the landlord has dictated the terms of the lease, any\\ndoubts about restrictive lease terms, whose scope and effect are not clear, will be resolved in favor of the tenants.\\nMutual Paper Co. v.

In order for you to recover under G.L. c. 186, §14, the landlord does not have to intentionally\\ntry to disturb you; it is her conduct and not her intentions that is controlling. Blackett v.

The Consumer Protection Act, G.L. c. 93A, was explicitly extended to cover owners and tenants by St. 1971,\\nChapter 241, approved by the Legislature on April 29, 1971. The 1971 amendment gave the protection of the\\nMassachusetts Consumer Protection Act to \"any person who purchases or leases goods or services, real or personal,\\nprimarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\" The next year the Legislature passed St. 1972, Chapter 123.\\nThis amendment explicitly expanded the definition of \"trade\" and \"commerce\" in G.L. c. 93A to include rental\\n298 ▲ Chapter 12: Evictions\\n\\nhousing by amending §1(b) of G.L. c. 93A. In Leardi v. Brown, 394 Mass. 151 (1985), the Supreme Judicial Court\\nnoted that tenants are among those for whose benefit the Consumer Protection law was passed. The Supreme\\nJudicial Court noted that: \"The 1972 amendment to the definition of trade or commerce, adding express reference\\nto the renting and leasing of services or property, did not expand, but only clarified, the scope of the words \\'trade\\'\\nor \\'commerce\\'.\" Commonwealth v. DeCotis, 366 Mass. 234, 239 (1975). For a detailed discussion of the purposes of\\nG.L. c. 93A, see Slaney v. Westwood Auto, 366 Mass. 688 (1975), and PMP Assocs. Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., 366 Mass.\\n593, 596 (1975).\\n156. G.L. c. 93A, §2(a) prohibits \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\" The\\ndefinition of \"act or practice\" in the Attorney General\\'s \"General Regulations\" was amended in 1975 to include \"any\\nthreat or attempt to perform such act or practice.\" See 940 C.M.R. §3.01(1). The Attorney General has further\\ndeclared that an act or practice is in violation of G.L. c. 93A, §2 if it is oppressive or otherwise unconscionable in\\nany respect. 940 C.M.R. §3.16(1).\\n157. Kachadorian v. Larson, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 1111 (2015)(compensatory damages awarded to the tenant for landlord’s\\ndiscrimination offset the rent owed when a defense under G.L. c. 239, §8A defense has been established through a\\nconditions claim.)\\n158. Counterclaims in summary process are not compulsory. U.S.P.R. 5.\\n159. G.L. c. 239, §8A.\\n160. G.L. c. 239, §8A. There are several possible rationales for this defense. One is that the plain language of G.L. c. 239,\\n§8A says that claims can be used as a defense. Another is that if the court awards the tenant any money on her\\ncounterclaims in a no-fault eviction that is not based on non-payment of rent, then the tenant will have recovered\\nmore money than the landlord and will retain possession under G.L. c. 239, §8A. A third possible rationale is that\\nG.L. c. 239, §8A creates a \"clean hands\" doctrine that prohibits a landlord who has violated her tenant\\'s rights from\\nregaining possession in an eviction where the tenant is without fault.\\n161. Spence v. O\\'Brien, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 489 (1983). This case did not define \"fault,\" but made it clear that it is more than\\nany \"cause\" and must involve \"wrongdoing\" or the toleration of another\\'s \"wrongdoing.\"\\n162. Ednson Realty Trust v. Robinson, Hampden Housing Court, 88-SP-7252-C (Abrashkin, J., Nov. 21, 1988). In Ednson\\nRealty, the court rejected a landlord\\'s claim that G.L. c. 239, §8A precludes counterclaims in fault-based evictions.\\nThe court noted that §8A and U.S.P.R. 5 state that counterclaims shall be permitted in no-fault cases, but do not say\\nthat they cannot be permitted in other cases. It also noted that other counterclaims are available outside of §8A and\\nthat courts retain discretion under U.S.P.R. 5 to sever those counterclaims where appropriate.\\n163. G.L. c. 239, §5; U.S.P.R. 12.\\n164. G.L. c. 239, §5. \"Such bond shall also be conditioned to pay to the plaintiff, if final judgment is in plaintiff\\'s favor,\\nall rent accrued at the date of the bond, all intervening rent, and all damage and loss which the plaintiff may sustain\\nby the withholding of possession of the land or tenements demanded and by any injury done thereto during such\\nwithholding, with all costs, until delivery of possession thereof to such plaintiff.\"\\n165. G.L. c. 239, §5 has been amended several times. One somewhat recent amendment, St. 1985, c. 754, made waiver of\\nthe appeal bond mandatory where the tenant is indigent and has a non-frivolous defense. A defense is not frivolous\\nmerely because it lacks merit, and the court should not find a defense frivolous unless it does not have a \"prayer of\\na chance.\" See Pires v. Commonwealth, 373 Mass. 829, 838 (1977).\\nThe indigency requirement is automatically met if the tenant: (a) receives TAFDC, EAEDC, SSI, MassHealth\\n(formerly Medicaid), or Massachusetts Veterans\\' Benefits or (b) has after-tax income of 125% or less of the federal\\npoverty level. G.L. c. 261, §27A. If the tenant does not automatically meet this standard, she must prove that she\\ncannot pay the bond without depriving herself or her family of the necessities of life by filing a Motion and\\nAffidavit of Income and Expenses.\\nChapter 12: Evictions ▲ 299\\n\\n166. Kargman v. Dustin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 101, 359 (1977) discussed the application of a previous version of the waiver\\nstatute. If you are indigent and have a non-frivolous appeal, the entire bond (but not current payments) must be\\nwaived. The current statute, G.L. c. 239, §5, as amended by St. 1985, c. 754, requires the tenant for whom the bond\\nhas been waived to pay rent in installments as it comes due and further requires that \"no court shall require any\\nsuch person to make any other payments or deposits.\" If the judge misapplies this law and sets bond in the amount\\nof back rent owed, the tenant should appeal the bond decision, as discussed below.\\n167. Kargman v. Dustin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 101 (1977). In Warner v. DeCosta and Eaton, Essex Superior Court, 86-1994\\n(Flannery, J., Aug. 28, 1986), the court reduced periodic payments from the contract rent of $600 to $300 based\\nupon hardship to the tenant, who had lost income due to an auto accident.\\n168. G.L. c. 239, §5.\\n169. G.L. c. 239, §9. The standard for granting a stay of execution is quite broad but is often overlooked. G.L. c. 239,\\n§10 provides that a stay may be granted if, after making a reasonable effort, \"the applicant cannot secure suitable\\npremises for himself and his family elsewhere within the city or town in a neighborhood similar to that in which the\\npremises occupied by him are situated . . . .\" It should not be necessary for the tenant to prove that she has not been\\nable to find any apartment anywhere in order to get a stay. However, the law says only that the judge \"may\" grant a\\nstay. Since the judge has discretion, the more compelling your situation is, the greater your chances of getting a stay.\\n170. G.L. c. 239, §9.\\n171. If the judge grants a stay for less than the maximum length of time allowed by law, you can file a motion for an\\nadditional stay sometime before the end of the initial stay period. You should allow sufficient time to give the\\nlandlord at least one week\\'s notice before the hearing on your motion and have the hearing scheduled before\\nexpiration of the initial stay.\\n172. G.L. c. 239, §5. Note that this time period differs from the standard 30-day period applicable to civil actions in the\\nhousing court and superior court.\\n173. The landlord\\'s expenses for forcibly moving you out are considerable. If the landlord has to have your property\\nmoved and stored, it could cost her several thousand dollars. Only $2 is unconditionally allowed by statute, so the\\nlandlord may have trouble getting back any more from the tenant. G.L. c. 262, §17 provides: \"In the service of an\\nexecution of ejectment the fees shall be: for demand, one dollar; for delivery, one dollar; for all necessary expenses,\\nincluding packing, teaming and labor; and the officer may be allowed additional compensation by an order of the\\ncourt from which the execution issued.\"\\nThe courts have held that G.L. c. 262, §17 does not allow a landlord to recover from the evicted tenant the actual\\nconstable\\'s fees or moving costs. In Strang v. Marifiote, 12 Mass. App. Ct. Dec. 91, 94 (1956), the landlord sued the\\ntenant for $4.80 in court costs, a $25 constable\\'s fee, and $50 in moving costs. The court allowed him to collect only\\nthe $4.80, saying, \"[t]he plaintiff can only recover from the defendant the officer\\'s fees allowed by [G.L. c. 262, §17].\\nSince there is no provision in it for a fee of $25.00 charged by the constable, that item was therefore properly\\ndisallowed.\" The court also upheld the disallowance of the $50 moving fee, holding that such a fee did not come\\nunder the provision for \"necessary expenses, including packing, teaming and labor.\"\\n174. See Bing v. Roach, Hampden Housing Court, LE 1553-S-80 (Peck, J., Nov. 2, 1983) (tenant awarded double damages\\nand attorney\\'s fees for breach of quiet enjoyment where the landlord himself used lawful execution without\\nassistance of sheriff or constable and did not present writ to tenants). See also G.L. c. 239, §4; McGonigle v. Victor H. J.\\nBelleisle Co., 186 Mass. 310, 313 (1904) (landlord has no authority to remove tenant\\'s goods to a warehouse over\\ntenant\\'s objections); PAB v. Cooper/Cooper v. PAB, Hampden Housing Court, 98-SP-3796/98-TR-0158 (Abrashkin,\\nJ., 1998) (landlord who levies on a summary process execution and removes personal property from the premises\\ncannot sell the property and must place it in storage). But see Finnigan v. Hadley, 286 Mass. 345, 347 (1934) (landlord\\nhas implicit authority to store the tenant\\'s goods where tenant is absent for 2 months prior to the eviction).\\n175. G.L. c. 239, §3. Judge Abrashkin of the Hampden County Housing Court issued a memo (Feb. 27, 1989) directing\\nsheriffs and constables that the 48-hour notice period required prior to levying on an execution pursuant to G.L. c.\\n239, §3 does not include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. This is consistent with Mass. R. Civ. P. 6, which\\n300 ▲ Chapter 12: Evictions\\n\\nprovides that in computing any period of time of less than 7 days under any statute or rule, intermediate Saturdays,\\nSundays, and legal holidays are excluded in the computation.\\n176. G.L. c. 239, §3.\\n177 G.L. c. 235, §23 (added at 1987-1 Mass. Acts 728, §1). Any period during which the execution was stayed by the\\ncourt or by agreement is excluded from the 3-month period.\\n178. G.L. c. 239, §3. This protection applies where the tenant has paid the underlying money judgment and any use and\\noccupancy that has accrued since the judgment entered.\\n179. G.L. c. 239, §4. See endnote 175.\\n180. A \"lien\" is the right to take and sell someone\\'s property to recover money owed, unless that money is paid back.\\nG.L. c. 239, §4 gives the storer a lien for charges for storage that are imposed in accordance with the law.\\n181. Often, landlords pay from one to 3 months\\' storage in advance. If you remove your property within the pre-paid\\nperiod, you would not have any storage charges and should not have to pay the warehouse to get your property out.\\n182. Cases have held that a constable is liable for damage that he negligently causes, and have said that he has a duty to\\nuse reasonable care when removing a tenant\\'s goods. Gaertner v. Bues, 109 Wis. 165 (1901) (dictum); State ex rel. Carroll\\nv.

Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973). Berman and Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979), held that the\\nright to rent abatement commences from the time the landlord first has knowledge of the condition (contrary to the\\nsuggestion in Hemingway that it would begin only after the landlord had failed to repair in a reasonable amount of time).\\nAccord, McKenna v. Begin, 3 Mass. App. Ct. 168 (1975); Montanez v. Bagg, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 954 (1987).\\n10. McKenna v. Begin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304 (1977).\\n11. McKenna v. Begin, 3 Mass.

Most judges compute damages by assessing what major code violations there are in your apartment and determining the\\npercentage by which your use and enjoyment of the apartment has been diminished by the existence of these violations.\\nAfter the court determines the percentage reduction factor applicable to each major violation, the various percentages\\nare totaled to arrive at an aggregate percentage reduction factor. The \"reduced\" rent is applied to the period during\\nwhich your landlord knew of the defective conditions, yet failed to correct them. Thus, you can use this as a defense to a\\nnon-payment of rent charge (i.e., to reduce the amount of rent owed) or affirmatively to get money back from the\\nlandlord. McKenna v. Begin, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 304 (1977).\\n13. The owner cannot charge you a smaller amount of money simply to make up for the fact that your apartment is in bad\\ncondition and, by this method, reduce her damages, Montanez v. Bagg, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 954 (1987); McKenna v. Begin, 3\\nMass. App. Ct. 168 (1975). The amount of the rent reduction, or abatement, that you can get depends on the fair market\\nvalue, not on the amount of rent being charged, although this may be evidence of the fair market value of the apartment.\\nBoston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973). Therefore, when a tenant\\'s rent is subsidized, the amount of the\\nrent abatement is calculated based on the contract rent, not based on the amount of rent the tenant pays. This means\\nthat if a subsidized tenant pays $78 but the full contract rent is $500, the amount of the abatement will be based on $500\\nand not $78. Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982). See Smith v. Renbel Management Co., Hampden Housing Court, SP-\\n4383-S87 (Abrashkin, J., March 24, 1988); But see Serreze v. YMCA of W. Mass., Inc., 30 Mass.

These damages can be lessened by a set-off claim by your landlord for rent due. Simon v. Solomon, 385\\nMass. 91 (1982). In order for you to recover under G.L. c. 186, §14, the landlord does not have to intentionally try to\\ndisturb you; it is her conduct and not her intentions that is controlling. Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977). For\\nexample, the fact that an owner failed to provide heat because she could not afford to buy heating oil does not diminish\\nthe tenant\\'s right to recover for the loss of \"quiet enjoyment\" that occurred during the time the apartment was unheated.\\nLowery v. Robinson, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982).;see also Homesavers Council of Greenfield Gardens, Inc. v. Sanchez, 70 Mass.\\nApp. Ct. 453 (2007), for a full discussion of emotional distress damages under G.L. c. 186, §14.\\n19. See Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758 (1979). If you get G.L. c. 186, §14 damages and G.L. c. 93A damages,\\nthe courts have held that you are entitled only to one recovery. That is, if the only violation of G.L. c. 93A was that the\\nlandlord failed to fix the apartment properly, you can get only one recovery, either 93A or actual damages, whichever is\\ngreater, Wolfberg v. Hunter, 385 Mass. 390 (1982). If, on the other hand, the same act violates two different laws\\nprotecting two different rights, you can recover under both laws. Ianello v.

Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977). Owner rented an abutting premises as an entertainment lounge, from which\\namplified music and sounds of brawls frequently emanated late into the night. The landlord unsuccessfully argued that\\nhe was not personally responsible for the noise. The court found that he was responsible, as he had allowed the place to\\nbe used as a lounge. See also Manzaro v. McCann, 401 Mass. 880 (1988), where the court held that owner-caused noise\\nmay be sufficient to support a claim for breach of quiet enjoyment.\\n25. Homesavers Council of Greenfield Gardens v. Sanchez, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 453 (2007).\\n26. Manzaro v. McCann, 401 Mass. 880, 884-5 (1988).\\n27. Thus, when the tenants in Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977), moved out because of the continuing noise problem,\\nthey were not held liable for the rent that was technically continuing to accrue under their rental agreement. See also\\nCharles E. Burt v. Seven Grand Corp., 340 Mass. 124 (1959). In that case, commercial tenants were constructively evicted by\\nthe landlord\\'s refusal to provide heat, electricity, and elevator service. See also Cramer v. Knight Real Estate, Hampden\\nHousing Court, 91-SC-1875 (1992) (constructive eviction due to infestation).\\n28. Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson, 379 Mass. 196 (1979). Under the state Sanitary Code, a landlord must pay for the heat and\\nhot water unless there is a written rental agreement that says the tenant or occupant is responsible for the bill. 105\\nC.M.R. §§410.190 and 410.201. If there is no written rental agreement that specifically provides for payment by the\\ntenant, the tenant may bring a separate claim or counterclaim against the landlord to recover all money paid for heat and\\nhot water bills. Young v. Patukonis, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).\\n29. G.L. c. 186, §18. See, e.g. Scofield v.

However,\\nyou can still bring the retaliation claim; it is just harder to prove without the presumption. G.L. c. 186, §18. For examples\\nof cases in which the tenant won her retaliation claim, see Unachukwu v. Mitchell, Boston Housing Court, 06-SP-04259\\n(Edwards, Jr., J., Feb. 9, 2007); P.F. Holdings v.

The Consumer Protection Act, G.L. c. 93A, was explicitly extended to cover owners and tenants by Chapter 241 of the\\nActs of 1971 (approved April 29, 1971). The 1971 amendment gave the protection of the Massachusetts Consumer\\nProtection Act to \"any person who purchases or leases goods or services, real or personal, primarily for personal, family,\\nor household purposes.\" The next year the Legislature passed Chapter 123 of the Acts of 1972 (approved March 28,\\n1972). This amendment explicitly expanded the definition of \"trade\" and \"commerce\" in G.L. c. 93A to include rental\\nhousing by amending G. L. c. §1(b). In Leardi v. Brown, 394 Mass. 151 (1985), the Supreme Judicial Court noted that\\n“tenants are among those for whose benefit the Consumer Protection law was passed.” The Supreme Judicial Court\\nnoted that: \"The 1972 amendment to the definition of trade or commerce, adding express reference to the renting and\\nleasing of services or property, did not expand, but only clarified, the scope of the words \\'trade\\' or \\'commerce\\'.\"\\nCommonwealth v. DeCotis, 366 Mass. 234, 239 (1975). For a detailed discussion of the purposes of G.L. c. 93A, see Slaney v.\\nWestwood Auto, Inc., 366 Mass. 688 (1975), and PMP Assocs., Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., 366 Mass. 593, 596 (1975).\\n34. G.L. c. 93A, §2(a) prohibits \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\" The\\ndefinition of \"act or practice\" in the Attorney General\\'s \"General Regulations\" was amended in 1975 to include \"any\\nthreat or attempt to perform such act or practice.\" See 940 C.M.R. §3.01(1). The Attorney General has further declared\\nthat an act or practice is in violation of G.L. c. 93A, §2 if it is oppressive or otherwise unconscionable in any respect. 940\\nC.M.R. §3.16(1).\\n35. Chapter 406 of the Acts of 1979 (approved July 20, 1979) amended G.L. c. 93A, §9 by broadening recovery to cases in\\nwhich there was a showing of an \"injury\" as opposed to the earlier requirement of a showing of \"loss of money or\\nproperty.\" This was to correct an inadequacy in the law highlighted in Baldassari v. Public Finance Trust, 369 Mass. 33\\n(1975), where the plaintiff, who had suffered from the harassing debt collection practices of the defendant, was held not\\nto be able to recover damages because of his failure to show \"loss of money or property\" or the giving up of a right that\\nthe plaintiff did not otherwise have to give up. It may still be necessary to prove the existence of some injury or the\\npossibility of injury, since violation of the statute or regulations will not automatically create a claim for relief under G.L.\\nc. 93A. But once the injury is proved, you are able to recover at least the minimum monetary damages ($25 per violation)\\nand perhaps more if a larger dollar value can be related to the defendant\\'s action. Leardi v. Brown, 394 Mass. 151 (1985).\\nIn Hershenow v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co., 445 Mass. 790 (2006), the Supreme Judicial Court said that a causal connection\\nis required between the deceptive act and an adverse consequence or loss. The Court reaffirmed its holding in Leardi.\\n36. Homesavers Council of Greenfield Gardens, Inc. v. Sanchez, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 453 (2007).\\n37. G.L. c. 93A, §9(3) and (4). These provisions, however, allow an owner to limit your recovery to relief that the owner\\noffers to you in writing within 30 days, if the court finds that such an offer was reasonable. The statute of limitations for\\nsuch actions brought under laws intended to protect consumers, including G.L. c. 93A, is now four years. G.L. c. 260,\\n§5A, as amended in 1975. See Babco Industries, Inc. v. New England Merchants Nat\\'l Bank, 6 Mass. App. Ct. 929 (1978). Prior\\nto the effective date of G.L. c. 260, §5A, the period was set at three years, the general \"tort\" statute of limitations, by\\nChapter 777 of the Acts of 1973, Section 1, amending G.L. c. 260, §2A applicable to causes of action arising after\\nJanuary 1, 1974. Prior to that amendment, the period was two years.\\nFor a plaintiff to recover attorney’s fees and damages, “the violation of the legal right that has created the unfair or\\ndeceptive act or practice must cause the consumer some kind of separate, identifiable harm arising from the violation\\nitself.” Tyler v. Michaels Stores, 464 Mass. 492, 503 (2013).\\n38. G.L. c. 93A, §9(3) states that a plaintiff is entitled to at least double and up to triple damages. When a landlord\\'s actions\\nare clearly unlawful under the Attorney General\\'s regulations, that is sufficient grounds to hold her actions to be willful,\\njustifying the award of double or triple damages and attorney\\'s fees. Montanez v. Bagg, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 954 (1987); see\\nalso Heller v. Silverbranch Constr. Corp., 376 Mass. 621 (1978). Willfulness can also be established if the landlord refuses to\\nagree to a reasonable offer for settlement and thus \"force[s] the plaintiffs to litigate their claim.\" Heller v. Silverbranch\\n320 ▲ Chapter 13: When to Take Your Landlord to Court\\n\\nConstr. Corp., 376 Mass. 621, 628 (1978). On the other hand, you can still get actual damages even if the landlord did not\\nknow she was violating the law. \"The \\'willful or knowing\\' requirement of §9(3) goes not to actual knowledge of the terms\\nof the statute, but rather to knowledge, or reckless disregard, of conditions in a rental unit which, whether the defendant\\nknew it or not, amount to violations of the law.\" Montanez v. Bagg, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 954, 956 (1987).\\n39. In Billings v.

Attorney General\\'s General Regulations issued under authority granted by G.L. c. 93A, §2(c); 940 C.M.R. §3.16(3). It is a\\ngood idea to introduce the regulations into evidence if you have a case where you are relying on them to prove that the\\ndefendant committed an unfair and deceptive act. You cannot necessarily assume that the court will take judicial notice\\nof the regulations, see York v. Sullivan, 369 Mass. 157, 160 n.2 (1975), although a statute now states that regulations\\npublished in the Massachusetts Register (put out for sale every week in the Mass.

G.L. c. 93A,\\n§2(b) reads: \"It is the intent of the Legislature that in construing paragraph (a) of this section . . . the courts will be\\nguided by the interpretations given by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Courts to section 5(a)(1) of the\\nFederal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. §45(a)(1)), as from time to time amended.\" G.L. c. 93A, §2(c) states that the\\nAttorney General is authorized to make regulations consistent with the provisions of §2(b) interpreting the statute.\\nThe Supreme Court has approvingly said of the Federal Trade Commission\\'s guidelines that \"in measuring a practice\\nagainst the elusive, but congressionally mandated standard of fairness, it, like a court of equity, considers public values\\nbeyond simply those enshrined in the letter or encompassed in the spirit of the anti-trust laws.\" Federal Trade Commission\\nv. Sperry & Hutchinson Company, 405 U.S. 233, 244 (1972).\\nThe Supreme Judicial Court has explicitly adopted this Federal Trade Commission rule as a guide for interpreting G. L.\\nc. 93A. See PMP Assocs., Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., 366 Mass. 593, 596 (1975). Moreover, consistent with this broad\\nfederal standard, the Massachusetts Attorney General has declared that \"an act or practice is a violation of Chapter 93A,\\nSection 2 if [i]t is oppressive or otherwise unconscionable in any respect. . . .\" 940 C.M.R. §3.16, intro and (1). The\\napplication of this standard by the Supreme Judicial Court has led to rulings that the existence of an industry-wide\\nstandard does not constitute a defense to a Chapter 93A action. Commonwealth v. DeCotis, 366 Mass. 234, 240 (1974); 35\\nMass. Practice Series, §116. See Slaney v. Westwood Auto, Inc., 366 Mass. 688, 704 (1975) (93A \"is not subject to the\\ntraditional limitations of preexisting causes of action such as tort for fraud and deceit\"); Commonwealth v. DeCotis, 366\\nMass. 234, 244, n.8 (1974); Dodd v. Commercial Union, Inc., 373 Mass. 72 (1977); Heller v. Silverbranch Constr. Corp., 376 Mass.\\n621 (1978) (defendant\\'s defenses to common law causes of action insufficient to defend against 93A). Specifically, in\\nYork v. Sullivan, 369 Mass. 157 (1975), the court found that a landlord\\'s assurances that rent would remain stable during a\\none-year lease period bound him despite subsequent approval of a rent increase by HUD. In addition, the Supreme\\nJudicial Court has ruled that broad standards in another statute, similar to G. L. c. 93A are not unconstitutionally vague.\\nCommonwealth v. Gustafsson, 370 Mass. 181 (1976).\\nFinally, a violation of G.L. c. 93A will occur if an act or practice is unfair. See 35 Mass. Practice Series, §116 (Comment\\nat 46); Commonwealth v. DeCotis, 366 Mass. 234, 241 (1974) (mobile home park practice unfair). Similarly, an act need only\\nbe \"deceptive.\" In Lowell Gas Co. v. Attorney General, 377 Mass. 37 (1979), the court found that \"a practice is deceptive if it\\ncould reasonably be found to have caused a person to act differently from the way he otherwise would have acted.\" 377\\nMass. at 51.\\nChapter 13: When to Take Your Landlord to Court ▲ 321\\n\\n45. G.L. c. 93A, §9(3). The demand letter is a procedural prerequisite to any G.L. c. 93A action, and the failure to send an\\nappropriate letter will bar any subsequent suit. Entrialgo v. Twin City Dodge, Inc., 368 Mass. 812 (1975). However, if you are\\nasserting the 93A claim by way of counterclaim (for example, in an eviction case) or cross-claim, you do not have to\\nsend the demand letter because of special language in the next to the last sentence of G. L. c. 93A, §9(3), inserted by\\nChapter 406 of the Acts of 1979, Section 2.\\n46. G.L. c. 93A, §9(3). No relief is available in court from practices that are not listed in the demand letter. Entrialgo v. Twin\\nCity Dodge, Inc., 368 Mass. 812 (1975). For a full discussion of the requirements of a demand letter, see Slaney v. Westwood\\nAuto, Inc., 366 Mass. 688 (1975).\\n47. G.L. c. 93A § 9(3) (“The demand requirements of this paragraph shall not apply if the claim is asserted by way of\\ncounterclaim or cross-claim…”).\\n48. Even if your landlord sends you a written offer of settlement within 30 days, you can still sue. But if the court finds that\\nyour landlord\\'s offer was \"reasonable,\" your recovery will be limited to the relief offered by your landlord, plus attorney\\'s\\nfees and costs incurred before you rejected her offer. G.L. c. 93A, §9(3) and (4). See Kohl v. Silver Lake Motors, Inc., 369\\nMass. 795 (1976).\\nWhere a landlord has led a tenant to believe the rent will be stable for a year, and then tries to increase the rent during\\nthat year, it is not a \"reasonable\" settlement offer for the landlord to offer the tenant a lease cancellation without penalty\\nand no eviction until a court decision on the increase. York v. Sullivan, 369 Mass. 157 (1975).\\nWhile this 30-day letter procedure is a prerequisite for success under G. L. c. 93A, administrative remedies (where they\\nexist) need not be exhausted before bringing a G. L. c. 93A action. G.L. c. 93A, §9 (6) and (8), added by Chapter 939 of\\nthe Acts of 1973 (approved October 23, 1973), effectively overruling Gordon v. Hardware Mut. Casualty Co., 361 Mass. 582\\n(1972). Further, the existence of a separate statute regulating industry practice does not preclude the application of G.L.\\nc. 93A to the conduct in question. See, e.g., Dodd v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 373 Mass. 72 (1977) (insurance industry);\\nLowell Gas Co. v. Attorney General, 377 Mass. 37 (1979) (public utility company); Schubach v. Household Fin. Corp., 375 Mass.\\n153 (1978) (small loan company).\\nHowever, the court does have the power to require exhaustion of other remedies. See G.L. c. 93A, §9 (7). The existence\\nof a remedy in equity is no bar to bringing one at law (i.e., for money damages rather than an injunction). Slaney v.\\nWestwood Auto, Inc., 366 Mass. 688, 700 (1975).\\n49. G.L. c. 93A, § 9(3).\\n50. G.L. c. 93A, §9(3) and (4). However, \"even a wilful or knowing violator of §2 may limit his maximum potential damages\\nby making a reasonable offer of settlement.\" Kohl v. Silver Lake Motors, Inc., 369 Mass. 795, 803 (1976).\\n51. G.L. c. 260, § 5A. Rita v. Carella, 394 Mass. 822, 825–27 (1985).\\n52. G.L. c. 93A, §9(2).\\n53. G.L. c. 93A; 940 C.M.R. §3.17.\\n54. For a full discussion of the history and evolution of the tort liability of landlords, see Javins v. First Nat\\'l Realty Corp., 428\\nF.2d 1071, 1074-80 (D.C. Cir. 1970) cert. den. 400 U.S. 925 (1970); Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184\\n(1973);Crowell v. McCaffrey, 377 Mass. 443 (1979).\\n55. Crowell v. McCaffrey, 377 Mass. 443 (1979). In this case, the court ruled that the questions of owner liability for negligence\\nand breach of warranty of habitability had to go to the jury. This means that an owner can be held liable to a tenant for\\ndamage caused by the owner\\'s negligent failure to repair building and Sanitary Code violations. In Crowell, the injury\\noccurred when the tenant fell from a porch after the railing gave way. The Supreme Judicial Court found that it did not\\nmatter whether or not the tenant had rented the porch; the owner was still responsible when injury resulted from the\\nfailure to maintain the porch in accordance with the building and sanitary codes. The court said: \"Thus extension of the\\nwarranty [of habitability] to the ordinary residential tenancy at will, in accordance with the Hemingway decision, logically\\ncarries with it liability for personal injuries caused by a breach.\" 377 Mass. at 451.\\n56.

In George v. Jordan Marsh, 359 Mass. 244, 245, n.l. (1971), emotional distress was defined as any \"mental anguish, mental\\nsuffering, mental disturbance, mental humiliation, nervous shock, emotional disturbance, distress of mind, fright, terror,\\nalarm, [or] anxiety.\" The old rule limiting recovery was established in Spade v. Lynn & B.R.R., 168 Mass. 285, 290 (1897)\\n(\"there can be no recovery for fright, terror, alarm, anxiety, or distress of mind, if these are unaccompanied by some\\n\"physical injury; . . . and there can be no recovery for such physical injuries as may be caused solely by such mental\\ndisturbance, where there is no injury to the person from without\"). Over the years, however, a number of inroads were\\nmade into this rule. It was finally overturned in Dziokonski v. Babineau, 375 Mass. 555 (1978).\\nSee Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (damages allowed for emotional distress caused by landlord\\'s substandard\\nmaintenance of apartment); Homesavers Council of Greenfield Gardens v. Sanchez, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 453 (2007).\\n71. The severity of the emotional distress must be \"of a nature \\'that no reasonable [person] could be expected to endure it.\\'\"\\nAgis v. Howard Johnson Co., 371 Mass. 140, 145 (1976), quoting from Restatement (Second) of Torts, §46 (Comment j)\\nChapter 13: When to Take Your Landlord to Court ▲ 323\\n\\n(1965); see also Abdeljaber v.

The term \"negligent\" is a legal one. In law, a \"negligent\" act is essentially an unintentional but unreasonable act that\\nforeseeably will and actually does cause injury to another person. The rule for emotionally based physical injuries caused\\nby the defendant\\'s negligence was established in Cameron v. New England Tel. & Tel. Co., 182 Mass. 310, 312 (1902);\\nDriscoll v. Gaffey, 207 Mass. 102, 105-107 (1910); see also George v. Jordan Marsh, 359 Mass. 244 (1971).\\n73. Agis v. Howard Johnson, 371 Mass. 140 (1976).\\n74. Dziokonski v. Babineau, 375 Mass. 555, 568 (1978). Where mother of child who had been negligently struck by a car, upon\\nseeing her injured child, suffered severe shock and died, the court held:\\nIn cases of this character, there must be both a substantial physical injury and proof that the injury was caused by the\\ndefendant\\'s negligence. Beyond this, the determination whether there should be liability for the injury sustained depends\\non a number of factors, such as where, when, and how the injury to the third person entered into the consciousness of\\nthe claimant, and what degree there was of familial or other relationship between the claimant and the third person.\\nSee also Cohen v.

Pine v. Rust, Boston Housing Court, 13409 (King, J., 1986). While the tenants\\npresumably suffered an invasion of privacy, this claim was not raised in the suit.\\n79. In a New Hampshire case, the court said that a husband and wife, as tenants, had grounds to sue the owner for invasion\\nof privacy when they discovered he had \"bugged\" their bedroom and had apparently listened in on them. The \"invasion\"\\nin invasion of privacy need not be a physical intrusion by a person. Hamberger v. Eastman, 206 A.2d 239 (N.H. 1964).\\n80. 105 C.M.R. §§410.190, 410.201, and 410.354.

Boraas, 416 U.S. 1 (1974).\\nHowever, in a later case the Supreme Court required that municipalities not unduly restrict the meaning of \"family.\" See\\nMoore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494 (1977). State courts are split on the validity of such restrictions. Some interpret their\\nstate law in accord with Belle Terre. Others, construing regulations under state constitutions, view such restrictions\\nunfavorably.\\nIn City of Worcester v. Bonaventura, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 166 (2002), the Appeals Court interpreted a Worcester zoning\\nordinance defining \"lodging house,\" \"[t]aken together\" with definitions of \"dwelling\" and \"family,\" to hold that \"a\\nlodging house is clearly defined [by the City of Worcester] as a dwelling unit that is rented to 4 or more persons not\\nconstituting a family.\" In Worcester, a local zoning ordinance defines \"family\" for purposes of single- and multi-family\\ndwellings as one or more persons occupying a dwelling unit \"and living together as a single housekeeping unit, not\\nincluding a group of more than 3 persons who are not within the second degree of kinship.\"\\n11.

The U.S. District Court ruled in the Sang Vo case that the tenant families, whose\\nlandlord had commenced eviction proceedings against them as a result of city enforcement action against him, had a\\n\"manifest interest in maintaining a home and a landlord-tenant relationship.\" Therefore, the \"government cannot\\ndeprive [the tenants] of this interest without affording them [i.e., the tenants, not just the owner] due process of law.\"\\n13.

Under both the repair and deduct statute, G.L. c. 111, §127L, and the retaliatory eviction statute, G.L. c. 186, §18,\\n\"tenants of residential premises\" are covered. Both statutes were enacted to promote the enforcement of the state\\nSanitary Code in residential housing: the retaliatory eviction statute, by barring eviction of the tenant who reports\\nviolations; and the repair and deduct statute, by allowing tenants to fix violations themselves. Although rooming houses\\nare clearly \"residential premises,\" it is unclear whether the word \"tenant\" applies to a lodger of less than 3 months.\\nBecause the word \"tenant\" has different meanings in different contexts, there is a good argument that these statutes\\napply to all rooming house occupants. For example, in Brown v. Guerrier, 390 Mass. 631 (1983), the Court held that\\ntenants at sufferance are tenants for purposes of G.L. c. 111, §127H (authorizing petitions to enforce the state Sanitary\\nCode). Similarly, in Hodge v. Klug, 33 Mass. App. Ct. 746, 754-55 (1992), the Court held that the protections of G.L. c.\\n239, §8A, apply for \"tenants at sufferance.\" Both courts relied upon public policy considerations to reach these results.\\nThe Boston Housing Court has suggested that retaliation laws apply to boarding house occupants of less than 3 months.\\nIn Koen & Nash v. Onnessimo, Boston Housing Court, 19673 and 19674 (Daher, C.J., Oct. 30, 1985), the Court said: \"If\\nthe Defendant [owner] threw out the Plaintiffs [the boarding house occupants of less than 3 months] because they\\ncomplained of code violations, this Court would rule that an act of retaliation and would itself confer a tenancy upon the\\nPlaintiffs.\"\\n40.

If you live in a rooming house with a written tenancy agreement, the agreement may contain a list of reasons for eviction\\nand information about required notices.

These rights are derived principally from the governing statute, G.L. c. 140, §32A-32S. The Massachusetts Attorney\\nGeneral, exercising her authority under G.L. c. 140, §32S, and the Consumer Protection Law (G.L. c. 93A, §2), has\\npromulgated a comprehensive set of regulations governing mobile home parks. See 940 C.M.R. §10.00.\\n2. The official definition of \"manufactured home\" can be found at G.L. c. 140, §32Q. It says that: “the words\\n‘manufactured home’ shall mean a structure, built in conformance to the National Manufactured Home Construction\\nand Safety Standards which is transportable in one or more sections, which in the traveling mode, is eight body feet or\\nmore in width or forty body feet or more in length, or, when erected on site, is three hundred twenty or more square\\nfeet, and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling unit with or without a permanent\\nfoundation when connected to the required utilities, and includes the plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and electrical\\nsystems contained therein.”\\nThe size and space requirements of the law are intended to exclude from the definition of manufactured home such\\nthings as campers. The construction and safety standards mentioned by the law are embodied in rules adopted by the\\nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Found at 24 C.F.R. §3280 (1992), HUD\\'s rules concern\\nsuch issues as fire safety, space, light and construction requirements, plumbing and heating systems, and energy\\nconservation.\\n3.

This differs greatly from the non-mobile home tenancy, where the basis of the park owner/tenant relationship is the\\nlease or tenancy at will agreement, as modified or limited by statutes and regulations. While mobile home tenants may\\nhave a lease or tenancy at will agreement, the power of the mobile home park owner to terminate the mobile home\\ntenancy is so limited under G.L. c. 140, §32J that the traditional legal significance of those rental agreements is rendered\\nobsolete. In addition, the ability of the mobile home park owner to enforce the provisions of those agreements through\\neviction is so restricted, again by G.L. c. 140, §32J, that the provisions contained in those agreements are less meaningful\\nthan the rules.\\n14. 940 C.M.R. §10.00 et seq.\\n15.

The difference in the law between the 15-day cure period in the termination notice and the 20-day cure period required\\nbefore a park owner begins an eviction case is somewhat confusing. The statute appears to give tenants the extra five\\ndays to account for any delay caused by receiving the eviction notice by certified mail. A tenant should always receive the\\nbenefit of the more generous 20-day time period.\\n57. G.L. c. 140, §32J, ¶3(2), (3). Compare G.L. c. 186, §12, where the \"right to cure\" in tenancies at will is limited to once in\\nevery 12-month period. Under the law, when a mobile home tenant dies, the tenancy is automatically continued for a\\nperiod of one year from the date of death or the date a Probate Court appoints an administrator or executor (now called\\na “personal representative”) of the deceased tenant\\'s estate.

G.L. c. 239, §9 excepts from the delay provisions evictions where the tenancy has been \"terminated\" \"by a notice to quit\\nfor nonpayment of rent as provided in section twelve of chapter one hundred and eighty-six… .\" It can be argued that\\nthis provision has no applicability to mobile home tenants since G.L. c. 186, §12 provides that tenancies at will may be\\n\"terminated\" upon a 14-day notice where there has been non-payment of rent. Mobile home park owners are not\\npermitted to use this procedure to \"terminate\" for non-payment of rent, but must instead follow the provisions of G.L.\\nc. 140, §32J, which requires a 30-day notice. Accordingly, if a mobile home tenant can demonstrate that she meets all of\\nthe other requirements of G.L. c. 239, §§9-13, the tenant may be able to obtain a stay in the non-payment eviction.\\n67.

The notice to quit informed\\nher she had 90 days to vacate \"if you are a tenant\", but the new owner commenced summary process prior to the\\nexpiration of 90 days. The Judge dismissed the case based upon this.) See also FNMA v.

The use of injunctions as a substitute for summary process is frowned upon, because summary process is\\nconsidered an adequate remedy at law. See Attorney General v. Dime Savings Bank, 413 Mass. 284, (1992) (barring\\nforeclosing bank from evicting former owners or tenants of former owners by injunction for trespass). See also\\nSerreze v.

In some cases, though,\\neven if summary process is required, an owner may be able to get injunctive relief where there is an immediate\\ndanger that needs to be addressed pending the outcome of the eviction.

The criminal\\ntrespass statute, G.L. c. 266, §120, which allows arrest of persons not lawfully on property, does not apply if the\\nperson was an authorized occupant at some point prior to a claim of trespass.\\n24. Housing Courts allow the use of civil injunctions to declare that someone is a trespasser or licensee without right to\\noccupy. See Beacon Park Associates in previous note (single justice opinion authorizing injunction to exclude occupant\\nwho was a terminated licensee.) Seeking such an injunction avoids illegal self-help (and possible damages for doing\\nthat). However, if there is a colorable claim of a tenancy, courts will usually deny an injunction.\\n25.

The argument is that the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act (which expired December 31, 2014) applies where\\ntitle to the property changed in 2014 or earlier. Title VII of Public Law 111–22 section 702. The law protected\\ntenants of properties where the tenancy was initiated before the “notice of foreclosure,” and said that the successor\\ntook title to the property subject to the rights of the bona fide tenant. Notice of foreclosure is defined in section\\n702(c) as “the date on which complete title to a property is transferred to a successor entity or person as a result of\\nan order of a court or pursuant to provisions in a mortgage, deed of trust, or security deed.” As long as title passed\\nin or before 2014, the successor takes title subject to the tenant’s rights – the tenant got the rights at the time title\\ntransferred.\\nChapter 18: Tenants & Foreclosure ▲ 431\\n\\n46.

G.L. c. 93, §51(a)(3)(v) gives a consumer reporting agency the authority to give a \"consumer report\" to a person\\nusing the information in connection with the rental of residential property. While landlords can obtain what is\\ndefined as a \"consumer report\" without the consumer\\'s permission, landlords cannot obtain what is defined as an\\n\"investigate consumer report\" without the consumer\\'s permission. See G.L. c. 93, §53. An \"investigative consumer\\nreport\" is a report that includes information about a \"person\\'s character, general reputation, personal characteristics,\\nor mode of living\" obtained through personal interviews. See G.L. c. 93, §50. A \"consumer report\" is limited to\\ncredit information and cannot include specific information listed in the law. See G.L. c. 93, §52. Note: There is also\\na federal law that regulates consumer reports and provides protections for consumers called the Federal Fair Credit\\nReporting Act, 15 U.S.C. §1681 et seq.

Laws that regulate credit reporting agencies do not apply to a prospective landlord obtaining a reference from your\\nprior landlords or from another source, such as the Massachusetts Trial Court’s online database.\\n4. A landlord may also see a credit score in addition to the credit report. A credit score estimates your\\ncreditworthiness based specific factors that each are weighted differently when viewing your credit report. A credit\\nreport shows how you have paid each of your debts. While consumers have a right to receive a free copy of their\\ncredits reports once every 12 months, you may have to pay for a credit score. In some mortgage transactions, you\\nwill receive credit score for free from the mortgage lender.\\n5. 15 U.S.C. §1681a(d).\\n6.

Federal Laws\\nTitle VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (the federal Fair Housing Act), 42 U.S.C. §3601 et seq. The Fair Housing\\nAct was amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-430, § 13(a), 102 Stat. 1636\\n(1988), which became effective March 12, 1989. These amendments added \"familial status\" and disability to the\\nnondiscrimination provisions of the Fair Housing Act and greatly expanded the enforcement sections. See H.\\nComm. on the Judiciary, Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, H. Rep. No. 100-711 (1988), reprinted in 1988\\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2173; 134 Cong. Rec. H6491-6501 (daily ed. Aug. 8, 1988); 134 Cong. Rec. S10532-10569 (daily ed.\\nAug. 2, 1988); 134 Cong. Rec. H4898-4932 (daily ed. June 29, 1988) for a full presentation of the Congressional\\nintent behind the amendments. The Fair Housing Act was most recently amended in 1995. Specifically, §3607 was\\namended by the Housing for Older Persons Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-76, § 1, 109 Stat. 787 (1995). Current\\nprovisions of the Act prohibit the following discriminatory practices against the groups protected by the Fair\\nHousing Act: refusing to sell, rent, negotiate for, \"or otherwise make unavailable or deny\" a dwelling; discriminating\\nin the \"terms, conditions, or privileges of a sale or rental of a dwelling or in the provision of services or facilities in\\nconnection therewith\"; making or publishing any discriminatory statement in regard to a sale or rental;\\nmisrepresenting the availability of a dwelling; inducing a person to sell or rent any dwelling by representations about\\nthe presence of members of a protected class in the neighborhood; and discriminating in access to real estate\\nservices. 42 U.S.C. §§3604, 3606.\\nThe HUD regulations implementing the federal Fair Housing Act are at 24 C.F.R. §§100 et seq. Title VIII permits a\\ncomplaint to be filed within two years in a U.S. district court or in state court or within one year at HUD. 42 U.S.C.\\n§3610(a)(1)(A)(i); 42 U.S.C. §3613(a)(1)(A). If a timely complaint is filed with HUD, then the two-year court\\nlimitations period is tolled during the time that the HUD complaint is pending. 42 U.S.C. §3613(a)(1)(B). Certain\\nsingle-family homes and all owner-occupied two-, three-, and four-family dwellings are exempted under 42 U.S.C.\\n§3603(b), 24 C.F.R. §100.10(c). This exemption will not apply if any \"statement or advertisement\" is made, printed,\\nor published or caused to be made printed, or published, with respect to the rental of a dwelling that indicates any\\npreference, limitation, or discrimination on the grounds prohibited by Title VIII, 42 U.S.C. §§3603(b), 3604(c). Note\\nthat oral statements as well as written statements and advertisements are covered by this provision limiting the\\nexemption for single-family homes and two-, three-, and four-family dwellings under Title VIII. See Mayers v. Ridley,\\n465 F.2d 630, 649 (D.C. Cir. 1972) (en banc) (Wilkey, J., concurring); see also id. at 633 (Skelly Wright, J.,\\nconcurring) and 24 C.F.R. §§100.75(b), 100.75(c)(2). Note also that there is no exemption from Title VIII for\\ndiscrimination by those engaged in the business of selling, brokering, or appraising residential real property, 42\\nU.S.C. §§3605(a), 3605(b)(2) and 3606. Thus, although on occasions a landlord may be exempt from the provisions\\nof Title VIII, her broker will never be.\\nCivil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. §1982. Section 1982 protects American citizens against discrimination on the\\nbasis of race or color only. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has defined racial discrimination under §1982 broadly\\nso that it will encompass many national origin claims and some religion claims. See Shaare Tefila Congregation v. Cobb,\\n481 U.S. 615 (1987). Section 1982 covers all housing—unlike state and federal fair housing laws, which exempt\\nsome units in small buildings. This law is not directly enforced by federal agencies, so victims of discrimination\\nmust sue in court, which may award compensatory and punitive damages as well as equitable relief and attorney\\'s\\nfees. This remedy is useful because the applicable statute of limitations for filing a §1982 action in federal or state\\ncourt in Massachusetts is most likely three years, longer than that allowed for initial filings under the federal Fair\\nHousing Act or G.L. c. 151B.

It applies only to housing that has some federal financial assistance (such as federally financed public\\nhousing, Section 8 project-based or HUD-subsidized housing). While there is a private right of action under Title\\nVI against state or local agencies that receive federal funds, see Guardians Association v. Civil Service Commission of New\\nYork City, 463 U.S. 582, 593-97, 624-28, 635-36 (1983), courts are not in agreement as to whether a private right of\\naction is available against HUD or other federal agencies.

A complaint must be filed within four years after the cause of action accrues.\\n2. In this chapter, we focus on owners (and their employees and agents) and brokers or real estate agents who illegally\\ndiscriminate in renting housing. The federal and state fair housing laws and court decisions prohibit discrimination\\nby several other entities involved in housing, such as federal, state, and local governments, newspaper advertisers,\\nbanks and mortgage companies, insurance companies, appraisers, local governments that enact discriminatory\\nzoning laws, and public housing authorities that refuse to administer certain housing subsidies. Discrimination in\\nhousing sales, financing, advertising, insuring, and appraising is also illegal. However, space constraints compel us to\\nconcentrate on owners and agents as these are the people tenants are most likely to deal with.\\n3. Federal Laws\\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, codified at 29 U.S.C. §794 (Supp. IV 2004), prohibits discrimination\\non the basis of disability in programs and activities conducted by HUD or that receive financial assistance from\\nHUD. 29 U.S.C. §794(a) provides that \"[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . .\\nshall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\\nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. . . .\" This law\\napplies only to housing that receives federal financial assistance such as federally aided public housing or HUD-\\nsubsidized housing. The law also applies to state-aided or subsidized housing if the public housing agency receives\\nany federal money for housing (which almost all do). See also HUD §504 regulations (at 24 C.F.R. §§8.1 et seq.).\\nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, codified at 42 U.S.C. §12132, bans disability discrimination\\nin services of state and local governments, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance.\\nState Laws\\nChapter 722 of the Acts of 1989 modifies several provisions of Massachusetts law, most importantly, G.L. c. 151B,\\nby extending to disabled persons the right to be free from housing discrimination, enhancing enforcement\\nproceedings for all protected groups, and conforming state law to the federal Fair Housing Act.\\n138 ▲ Chapter 7: Discrimination\\n\\nAmendment Article 114 to the Massachusetts Constitution provides that \"[n]o otherwise qualified handicapped\\nindividual shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, denied the benefits of, or be\\nsubject to discrimination under any program or activity within the Commonwealth.\" Amendment Article 114 was\\napproved and ratified on November 4, 1980. The language of the amendment applies to public and private conduct,\\nthereby providing protection with respect to all types of housing regardless of any federal or state involvement and\\nregardless of the size or type of housing.\\n4. M.G.L. c. 151B, §§4(6), (7), prohibits discrimination in housing based on a tenant\\'s \"age,\" but the statute\\'s\\nprotections do not apply to \"minors nor to residency in state-aided or federally-aided housing developments for the\\nelderly nor to residency in housing developments assisted under the federal low income housing tax credit and\\nintended for use as housing for persons 55 years of age or over or 62 years of age or over, nor to residency in\\ncommunities consisting of either a structure or structures constructed expressly for use as housing for persons 55\\nyears of age or over or 62 years of age or over if the housing owner or manager register biennially with the\\ndepartment of housing and community development.\" The federal Fair Housing Act does not include \"age\" as a\\nprotected category.\\n5. The federal Fair Housing Act applies to \"dwellings,\" which include any building \"occupied as, or designed or\\nintended for occupancy as, a residence by one or more families . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. §3602(b). The state anti-\\ndiscrimination law applies to \"housing accommodations,\" which include any building \"which is used or occupied or\\nis intended, arranged or designed to be used or occupied, as the home, residence or sleeping place of one or more\\nhuman beings.\" G.L. c. 151B, §1(9).\\n6. The federal Fair Housing Act has been interpreted to apply to various residences that were temporary in nature. See,\\ne.g. United States v. Hughes Memorial Home, 396 F.

Long, remanded on other grounds, 537 F.2d 1151 (4th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 429 U.S.\\n871 (1976). Delaying minority applications also constitutes the imposition of more stringent terms. See Williamsburg\\nFair Housing v. N.Y.C. Housing Auth., 493 F. Supp. 1225 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), aff\\'d without opinion, 647 F.2d 163 (2d\\nCir. 1981); Luna v. Lynch, 82-BPR-0083 (MCAD 1985). HUD has rejected the argument that different security\\ndeposits should be permitted for tenants with children or a physical disability (Preamble II, 24 C.F.R. ch. 1, subch.\\nA, app. 1 at 54 Fed.

General Servs. Corp., 659 F. Supp. 1042 (E.D. Va. 1987).\\nThe provision is not limited to advertising. HUD regulations specifically include oral and written statements made\\nby a person engaged in the rental of a dwelling. See 24 C.F.R. §100.75(b). See also Mayers v. Ridley, 465 F.2d 630, 649\\n(D.C. Cir. 1972) (en banc). Also, G.L. c. 151B, §4(7B) mirrors the language of Title VIII and thus oral or written\\nnotices or statements would also be violations under state law.\\n11.

The courts\\nhave made clear that these avoidance techniques are condemned. See, e.g., Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins.

The theory of this type of fair housing violation is a “disparate impact” theory and is where a policy or practice\\nwhich may appear to be neutral, adversely or disparately affects one group of people of a protected class more than\\nanother.

Massachusetts law prohibits discrimination in housing because a child or children will occupy the rented premises,\\nbut exempts: (1) two-family owner-occupied buildings; (2) buildings with three or fewer units if one unit \"is\\noccupied by an elderly or infirm person for whom the presence of children would constitute a hardship\"; and (3) a\\ntemporary rental (less than one year) of the owner’s principal place of residence. G.L. c. 151B, §§4(11)(1)-(11)(3).\\nThese exemptions, however, do not apply to §4(7B)\\'s ban on discriminatory statements and advertising, nor do they\\napply to persons whose business includes engaging in residential real estate-related transactions. See 804 C.M.R.\\n§§2.01(4)(b)-(4)(c).\\nThe federal Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§3602(k), 3604, and 3606, forbids housing discrimination based on\\n\"familial status.\" \"Familial status\" was added by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988. The federal law does\\nnot apply to owner-occupants of one- to four-family homes (the so-called \"Mrs. Murphy\" exemption). 42 U.S.C.\\n§3603(b)(2); 24 C.F.R. §100.10(c)(2). The rental or sale of a single-family house by an owner who has not sold a\\nhouse within the previous 24 months, who does not own more than three single-family houses, who does not use a\\nreal estate agent or broker to sell or rent the house, and who does not use a discriminatory advertisement, is also\\nexempt from the Act. 42 U.S.C. §3603(b)(1); 24 C.F.R. §100.10(c)(1). Similar to Massachusetts law, the Fair Housing\\nAct\\'s ban on discriminatory statements and advertising (contained in 42 U.S.C. §3604(c)) is not subject to these\\nexemptions. 42 U.S.C. §3603(b). Moreover, even where a landlord does have an exemption, the landlord\\'s broker\\nmay not legally discriminate against children. See 42 U.S.C. §3605.\\n21. See 42 U.S.C. §3602(k); 804 C.M.R. §2.02(2). See also, G.L. c. 186, § 16, stating that any lease or rental agreement\\nthat terminates the contract if the tenant has or will have a child is void and against public policy.\\n22. See G.L. c. 151B §4(11)(2). A landlord is also allowed to exclude children where a dwelling contains three\\napartments or less and one of the units is occupied by an elderly or infirm person for whom the presence of\\n140 ▲ Chapter 7: Discrimination\\n\\nchildren would constitute a hardship. G.L. c. 151B, §4(11)(1). The law also allows children to be excluded when a\\nlandlord temporarily leases (for up to one year) a single-family residence or unit that the landlord ordinarily\\noccupied as his or her principal residence. G.L. c. 151B §4(11)(2).\\n23. See 42 U.S.C. §§3607(b)(1)-(3). The Massachusetts law prohibiting housing discrimination against families with\\nchildren does not specifically exempt housing for older person, see G.L. c. 151B §4(11); however, the prohibition\\nagainst housing discrimination based on age does contain such a limitation. See G.L. c. 151B §§4(6)-(7).\\n24. See 42 U.S.C. §3604(c); G.L. c. 151B, §4(7B).\\n25. See 42 U.S.C. §3605; G.L. c. 151B, §4(3B).\\n26. The Massachusetts Lead Poisoning Prevention and Control statute is at G.L. c. 111, §190. The law requires all\\nowners of residential buildings to remove or cover lead paint in places where a child under the age of six lives or\\nseeks to live. The law specifically applies to an owner who tries to avoid lead paint liability by discriminating against\\na family with children, even if that family does not yet reside in the apartment or house. G.L. c. 111, §199A.\\nG.L. c. 151B, §4(11) specifically obligates the Mass. Commission Against Discrimination or a court which finds\\ndiscrimination against families with children because of the presence of lead paint to refer such cases to the director\\nof the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program which is located in Boston.\\n27. However, depending on the reason for the question, it may be possible for a landlord or her agent to inquire about\\nthe age of children who may be tenants. At least one court has upheld the decision of a HUD Administrative Law\\nJudge who concluded that the Fair Housing Act was not violated when a real estate agent asked a prospective tenant\\nabout the number and age of her children in order to secure a quiet neighbor for an existing elderly tenant. Soules v.\\nU.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, 967 F2d 817 (2nd Cir. 1992).\\n28. Two federal acts require landlords, including landlords with units paid for by Section 8 vouchers, to inspect\\napartments in which children live or will live for lead paint. See 42 U.S.C. §§4821-4846 (the Lead-Based Paint\\nPoisoning Prevention Act) and 42 U.S.C. §4851 (Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992). See\\nalso Voucher Program Guidebook: Housing Choice, U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development,\\nhttp://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/hcv/forms/guidebook. See\\nalso the DHCD Lead Law Policy Notebook, available at the State House Bookstore (617-727-2834).\\nThe DHCD policy was, in part, a reaction to the holding in the case of Ayala v. Boston Housing Auth., 404 Mass. 689\\n(1989), which held that the Boston Housing Authority had a duty to inspect a Section 8 unit for lead paint and\\nmight be liable for a child\\'s poisoning in a unit that it failed to inspect. The court also held that the tenants were\\nthird-party beneficiaries of the contracts between BHA and the landlord and could thus sue for breach of those\\ncontracts. If a landlord denies you housing because you are a Section 8 recipient and the rules of the program\\ndemand that she delead the unit, then she may be discriminating on the basis of your receipt of a rental subsidy in\\nviolation of G.L. c. 151B, §4(10), which prohibits discrimination \" … because of any requirement of such … rental\\nassistance or housing subsidy program.\" If the discrimination was based on the receipt of rental assistance, then the\\nexemption for owner-occupants of two-family homes does not apply. No owner can discriminate on this basis.\\n29. See G.L. c. 111, § 197 (requiring landlords to remove, abate, or contain lead paint in a unit rented to a family with\\nchildren under six years of age.) If there is not yet an executed lease, the landlord may delay the start of the tenancy,\\nno longer than thirty days, to delead the apartment. G.L. c. 111, § 197(h).\\n30. It is also illegal for landlords to refuse to accept Section 8 or any rental assistance subsidy. See G.L. c. 151B, § 4(10).\\n31. 42 U.S.C. §3604(b), as amended by the 1988 Act, explicitly forbids discrimination against any person \"in the terms,\\nconditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection\\ntherewith, because of … familial status.\" In Glover v. Crestwood Lake Section 1 Holding Corps., 746 F. Supp. 301, 309-10\\n(S.D.N.Y. 1990), the court held that a landlord\\'s refusal to rent a one-bedroom unit to a person with a child, or a\\ntwo-bedroom unit to a person with three children, violates the Fair Housing Act since the landlord had rented these\\napartments to childless households of the same size.\\nChapter 7: Discrimination ▲ 141\\n\\n32.

A recent national study, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), found\\nthat African-American and Hispanic people looking for rental apartments are still discriminated against in cities\\nacross the country.

Mass. 1985), remanded for remedial\\norder, 817 F.2d 149 (1st Cir. 1987), that HUD had failed in its duty to promote fair housing in administering its\\nfederally funded housing and community development programs in the city of Boston. On March 8, 1991, Federal\\nDistrict Judge Walter Skinner approved a consent decree between the NAACP and HUD, which also incorporated\\nsettlement agreements between the city of Boston and HUD, as well as between EOCD and HUD.\\n40. Ch. 151B, §1(16), (17), and §4(3C), (4A), (6)-(7B). In federal law, the key provisions are in the Fair Housing\\nAmendments Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-430, §13(a), 102 Stat. 1636 (1988), codified at 42 U.S.C. §§3601 et seq.\\nBoth the state and federal law add persons with disabilities to the list of those protected against discrimination. Both\\nlaws, with the state law being generally stronger, provide that landlords must make \"reasonable accommodations\" to\\npersons with disabilities so that they can rent and enjoy housing on an equal basis with those who are not disabled.\\nAnother federal law protecting disabled people from housing discrimination, but only in \"federally assisted\"\\nhousing, is Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, codified at 29 U.S.C. §794.\\n41. G.L. c. 151B, §4(7A); 42 U.S.C. §3604(f).\\n142 ▲ Chapter 7: Discrimination\\n\\n42. State law, at G.L. c. 151B, §1(17), uses the same definition of \"handicap\" as the federal Fair Housing Act does. The\\nfederal Fair Housing Act and implementing regulations define \"handicap\" as (1) a \"physical or mental impairment\\nwhich substantially limits one or more of [a] person\\'s major life activities,\" (2) a record of having such an\\nimpairment, or (3) being regarded as having such impairment. 42 U.S.C. §3602(h); 24 C.F.R §100.201. Section 504\\nhas a similar definition. See 29 U.S.C. §§705(9)(B), 705(20)(B).\\nNote that the federal law does not include as a \"handicap\" the current illegal use of or an addiction to a controlled\\nsubstance. 42 U.S.C. §3602 (h)(3), 24 C.F.R. §100.201. (However, recovering drug abusers in a treatment program\\nwould not be excluded if they do not currently use illegal drugs. See House Judiciary Comm., Fair Housing\\nAmendments Act of 1988, H.R. Rep. No. 711, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 25, 28-29, reprinted at 1988 U.S. Code Cong. &\\nAdmin. News 2173, 2183-84.) State law, however, makes no exclusion for drug addicts.\\nAlso, the federal law is explicit that discrimination protections are not to extend to any individual whose tenancy\\nwould constitute a \"direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in\\nsubstantial physical damage to the property of others.\" 42 U.S.C. §3604(f)(9); 24 C.F.R. §100.202(d). In contrast, the\\nstate law, G.L. c. 151B, includes no language exempting such persons from protection against discrimination. The\\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has held that a public housing authority may evict a tenant who requests a\\nreasonable accommodation but poses a threat to others, but before doing so it must show that an attempt to\\naccommodate the tenant has failed or that there is no reasonable accommodation that will acceptably minimize the\\nrisk to other residents. Boston Housing Authority v. Bridgewaters, 452 Mass. 833, 841 (2009).\\n43. This section addresses only the disability laws regarding private housing. The laws regarding public and subsidized\\nhousing are different and can be more complicated. To get information on how the disability laws apply to public\\nand subsidized housing providers, see forthcoming Legal Tactics: Finding Public and Subsidized Housing (2nd\\nEdition, 2006), available at MCLE and online at: http://www.masslegalhelp.org/.\\nIn addition, sometimes a person will have a CORI (or a poor credit report) because she is survivor of domestic\\nviolence. If this is the case, you should explain the circumstances to the landlord. It may be sex discrimination to\\ndeny someone housing based on a CORI or poor credit report that is the result of someone’s being a victim of\\ndomestic violence. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. Dev., Assessing Claims of Housing Discrimination against Victims\\nof Domestic Violence under the Fair Housing Act (FHAct) and the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) (Feb. 9,\\n2011). Evictions actions against victims of domestic violence because of acts of domestic violence can also be\\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex. See Bouley v. Young-Sabourin, 394 F. Supp. 2d 675 (D. Vt. 2005). Massachusetts law\\nalso provides certain protections for victims of domestic violence allowing them to break a lease early and request\\nthat the locks be changed (for a reasonable fee). G.L. c. 186, §§24, 26. In both cases, the landlord may request proof\\nthat the individual is a victim of domestic violence, such as a copy of a court prevention of abuse order or a police\\nreport. The law also provides that if a victim of domestic violence exercises his right to terminate his lease early due\\nto domestic violence, a future landlord cannot use that as a reason not to rent to him, nor can a housing subsidy\\nprovider use that as a basis to deny rental assistance. G.L. c. 186, §25.\\n44. A housing provider violates the federal Fair Housing Act when the provider’s policy or practice has an unjustified\\ndiscriminatory effect, even when the provider had no intent to discriminate. Where a policy or practice that restricts\\naccess to housing on the basis of criminal record has a disparate impact on individuals of a particular race, national\\norigin, or other protected status, such policy or practice is unlawful under the Fair Housing Act. See U.S.\\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development Office of General Counsel Guidance on Application of Fair\\nHousing Act Standards to the Use of Criminal Records by Providers of Housing and Real Estate-Related\\nTransactions (April 4, 2016). See also U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Notice PIH 2015-19,\\nGuidance for Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) and Owners of Federally-Assisted Housing on Excluding the Use of\\nArrest Records in Housing Decisions (Nov. 2, 2015) (prohibiting landlords who receive federal funding from\\nrelying on arrest records only to deny admission to or evict tenants).\\n45. G.L. c. 6, §172(32)(d). This law states: \"Except as authorized by this section it shall be unlawful to request or require\\na person to provide a copy of his criminal offender record information.\"\\n46. 42 U.S.C. §3602(h); Peabody Properties, Inc. v. Sherman, 418 Mass. 603 (1994).\\n47. The fair housing laws do not give a definition of current use of illegal drugs. However, the Americans with Disabilities\\nAct defines current use of drugs as \"illegal use of drugs that occurred recently enough to justify a reasonable belief\\nChapter 7: Discrimination ▲ 143\\n\\nthat a person\\'s drug use is current or that continuing use is a real and ongoing problem.\" 28 C.F.R. §35.104; 28\\nC.F.R. §36.104. In addition, the law regarding public and subsidized housing states that \"[a] person\\'s illegal use of a\\ncontrolled substance within the preceding 12 months shall create a presumption that such person is a current illegal\\nuser of a controlled substance, but the presumption may be overcome by a convincing showing that the person has\\npermanently ceased all illegal use of controlled substances. This disqualification of current illegal users of controlled\\nsubstances shall not apply to applicants for housing provided through a treatment program for illegal users of\\ncontrolled substances.\" 760 CMR §5.08(1)(k).\\n48. G.L. c. 121B, §32; 760 CMR §5.08(2).\\n49. The federal Fair Housing Act requires \"reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when\\nsuch accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.\" 42\\nU.S.C. §3604(f)(3)(B). See 24 C.F.R. §100.204. The concept of \"reasonable accommodations\" was drawn from §504\\nof the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §794 (see 53 Fed. Reg. 45003, November 7, 1988), which prohibits\\ndiscrimination against disabled people in federally assisted housing. This reliance on §504 is significant, because\\nthere is a limited body of §504 case law elaborating upon the \"reasonable accommodations\" concept under §504.\\nSee, e.g., Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397 (1979), and Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985). See\\nHouse Judiciary Comm., Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, H.R. Rep. No. 711, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 25, 28-\\n29, reprinted at 1988 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 2173, 2189-90. For a very helpful Massachusetts case\\ndecided under §504, see City Wide Assocs. v. Penfield, 409 Mass. 140 (1991). In that case, a landlord was attempting to\\nevict an elderly mentally disabled tenant who, because she heard voices in the walls, banged at and threw things at\\nthe walls in her apartment. The Supreme Judicial Court held that under §504 the landlord had an obligation to\\nreasonably accommodate her handicap by stopping the eviction action and giving her an opportunity to obtain\\nmental health counseling. The court seemed to agree that the damage caused by the tenant (less than one month\\'s\\nrent) was not significant, especially since the cost was reimbursable by a public agency.\\nThe Massachusetts Appeals Court, interpreting §504 in Whittier Terrace Assocs. v. Hampshire, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 1020\\n(1989) (rescript), has ruled that a disabled woman who is psychologically dependent upon her cat should be\\npermitted an exception to the landlord\\'s no-pet rule.\\nA very useful guide on what may or may not qualify as either a reasonable accommodation or a reasonable\\nmodification can be found in the joint statements on reasonable accommodations and modifications put out by\\nHUD and the Department of Justice. Joint Statement of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and\\nthe Department of Justice, Reasonable Accommodations Under the Fair Housing Act (May 17, 2004); Joint Statement of\\nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Justice, Reasonable Modifications Under\\nthe Fair Housing Act (Mar. 5, 2008).\\nAlthough not precisely defining reasonable accommodations, the HUD fair housing regulations give several\\nexamples illustrating the range of accommodations required by the law, such as a no-pets policy that should be\\nwaived for a seeing-eye dog, provision of a preferred parking space for a mobility-impaired person, and more. See\\n24 C.F.R. §100.204(b). Note that, irrationally, reasonable accommodations under the HUD §504 regulations do not\\ninclude supportive services such as counseling, medical, or social services not provided to other tenants, but may\\ninclude, for example, assistance with trash removal for a physically disabled person. There is no analytic support for\\nthis restriction, and it runs counter to precedents in both the housing (Schuett v. Anderson, 386 N.W.2d 249 (Minn.\\nCt. App. 1986)) and education (Tatro v. Texas, 625 F.2d 557, 564 (5th Cir. 1980)) areas. Advocates should therefore\\nbe cautioned not to rely upon HUD\\'s §504 regulations as a correct statement of the law with respect to any aspect\\nof §504 analysis.\\nState law, at G.L. c. 151B, §4(7A), also includes the failure to make reasonable accommodations as an act of illegal\\ndiscrimination. This means, as under the federal law, that a person with a disability has a right to expect her landlord\\nto reasonably adjust rules or policies when necessary to allow her to live comfortably in her home. It is also illegal to\\nrefuse to rent to a person because she might need reasonable accommodations to the premises or to refuse to allow\\na tenant to make reasonable modifications to her apartment. Both the federal law (42 U.S.C. §3604(f)(3) and 24\\nC.F.R. §100.203) and state law require owners to allow disabled tenants to make reasonable modifications to their\\nunits at their own expense. This might include widening a doorway, installing a grab bar, putting in a louder\\ndoorbell, or lowering the light switches. However, the state law goes further for publicly assisted, multiple-dwelling\\nor other larger housing developments. In those forms of housing, reasonable modifications must be paid for by the\\nowner (in the case of public housing, this is subject to appropriation), but modifications are not considered\\nreasonable if they would impose undue hardship on the owner. Also, reasonable modifications do not include\\n144 ▲ Chapter 7: Discrimination\\n\\nramping for more than five steps or installing a wheelchair lift. G.L. c. 151B, §4(7A)(1) and (7A)(3). Under §504, the\\nonly limit on provision of reasonable accommodations including structural modifications is \"undue hardship.\" Thus,\\n§504, if available, may be the better route for structural modifications in certain situations.\\nWhether the issue is a physical change to an apartment or the altering of certain rules or policies, the question about\\nreasonable accommodations will most often be \"What is reasonable?\" State law says that a modification is not\\nrequired \"if it would impose an undue hardship upon the owner. … Factors to be considered shall include, but not\\nbe limited to, the nature and cost of the accommodation or modification needed, the extent to which the\\naccommodation or modification would materially alter the marketability of the housing, the overall size of the\\nhousing business of the owner … and the ability of the owner … to recover the cost … through a federal tax\\ndeduction,\" G.L. c. 151B, §4(7A)(3).\\nIn Andover Housing Authority v. Shkolnik, 443 Mass. 300 (2005), the Supreme Judicial Court held that a public housing\\nauthority did not violate the Fair Housing Act and M.G.L. c. 151B when it evicted a tenant with an alleged mental\\ndisability for excessive noise, and that the tenant\\'s requested withdrawal or delay of eviction proceedings was not\\nreasonable. Relying on language appearing in §504 of the Rehabilitation Act (but not in the Fair Housing Act or\\nM.G.L. c. 151B), the Court focused on whether the tenant was a \"qualified\" handicapped person and concluded he\\nwas not. According to the Court, \"[i]n the public housing context, a \\'qualified\\' handicapped individual is one who\\ncould meet the authority\\'s eligibility requirements for occupancy and who could meet the conditions of a tenancy,\\nwith a reasonable accommodation or modification in the authority\\'s rules, policies, practices, or services. Here, the\\ntenants made no showing that, even if eviction proceedings were withdrawn or delayed, they could comply with the\\nterms of their lease by not disturbing their neighbors.\" 443 Mass. at 310-311 (internal citations omitted).\\n50. See City Wide Assocs. v. Penfield, 409 Mass. 140, 143-44 (1991).\\n51. 42 U.S.C. §3604(f)(9); Andover Housing Authority v.

Golden Gate Gardens Apartments, 250 F.3d\\n1039, 1046 (6th Cir. 2001)) but see Boston Housing Authority v. Bridgewaters, 452 Mass. 833, 850 (2009)) (“before a public\\nhousing authority may terminate the lease of a disabled tenant . . . because he poses ‘a significant risk to the health\\nor safety of others’ that cannot be eliminated by a reasonable accommodation . . . the housing authority ‘must make\\nan individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best\\navailable objective evidence to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the\\npotential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will\\nmitigate the risk’”) (internal citations omitted).\\n52.

Under Massachusetts law, an owner must pay for reasonable\\naccommodations \"in the case of publicly assisted housing, multiple dwelling housing consisting of ten or more\\nunits, or contiguously located housing consisting of ten or more units….\" G.L. c. 151B, §4(7A)(1).\\n54. See G.L. c. 151B, §4(7A).\\n55. Testing has been held to be legal by every court that has dealt with the issue, including the U.S. Supreme Court,\\nwhich unanimously sanctioned testing by holding that testers who receive false information about the availability of\\nhousing have standing to sue under the Fair Housing Act. Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 373-79\\n(1982); see also Northside Realty Assocs., Inc. v. United States, 605 F.2d 1348, 1355 (5th Cir. 1979); Meyers v. Pennypack\\nWoods Home Ownership Ass\\'n, 559 F.2d 894, 897-98 (3rd Cir. 1977) (§1982 case).\\nMany courts have said that testing is often the most reliable evidence in a housing discrimination case even though\\ntesters \"misrepresent\" themselves.\\nTesting has been challenged on the basis that testers \"acted under false pretenses.\" This was rejected by the U.S.\\nCourt of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which said \"it would be difficult indeed to prove discrimination in housing\\nwithout this means of gathering evidence.\" Hamilton v. Miller, 477 F.2d 908, 909 n.1 (10th Cir. 1973); see\\nEducation/Instruction, Inc. v. Copley Management & Dev. Corp., 1 Fair Hous.-Fair Lend. (P-H) ¶15,530 (D. Mass. March\\n30, 1984). The federal district court for the district of Massachusetts in the Education/Instruction case asserted that the\\nChapter 7: Discrimination ▲ 145\\n\\nuse of testers was crucial to the enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and, therefore, any state act that obstructs the\\nuse of testers must be held invalid by virtue of the operation of the Supremacy Clause.\\n56. Also note that HUD funds testing programs under its Fair Housing Initiatives Program, authorized in §561 of the\\nHousing and Community Development Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-242, §561, 101 Stat. 1815, 1942-44 (1988),\\ncodified at 42 U.S.C. §3616a(b)(2)(A).\\n57.

Although many localities have human rights or fair housing commissions or committees, only a few of these have\\nenforcement powers. At the time of this writing, only the Boston Fair Housing Commission and the Cambridge\\nHuman Rights Commission have \"substantial equivalency\" status from HUD under the federal fair housing law.\\n61. As a matter of practice, most fair housing cases present a mixture of federal and state law which can be included in\\none court case.

D., The Mental Anguish and Humiliation Suffered by Victims of Housing Discrimination, 26 J.\\nMarshall L. Rev. 39 (1992).\\n65. 42 U.S.C. §3613(c)(1) authorizes the court in a Title VIII suit brought by an individual homeseeker to issue any\\npermanent injunction or other order that it \"deems appropriate.\" The district court has broad discretion, so that not\\nall cases in which liability is found will result in such an order. See Heights Community Congress v. Hilltop Realty, Inc., 774\\nF.2d 135, 144 (6th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1019 (1986).\\n42 U.S.C. §1982 provides no explicit method of enforcement, but the Supreme Court held that this does not\\nprevent a federal court from fashioning an effective equitable remedy. Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 414\\nn.13 (1968). Since 1968, the lower courts have awarded fair housing plaintiffs in §1982 cases the same relief as is\\navailable in private Title VIII cases. See Moore v. Townsend, 525 F.2d 482 (7th Cir. 1975); Smith v. Sol D. Adler Realty\\nCo., 436 F.2d 344, 350 (7th Cir. 1970).\\n42 U.S.C. §1981 is generally accorded the same treatment in terms of relief available as §1982. In Runyon v. McCrary,\\n427 U.S. 160, 190 (1976) (Stevens, J. concurring), it was stated that \"it would be most incongruous to give these two\\nstatutes a fundamentally different construction.\"\\nG.L. c. 151B, §9 provides for the court to issue injunctive relief. The court can award the same relief as under Title\\nVIII. G.L. c. 93, §102(b) provides for the court to award injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief. G.L. c.\\n12, §11H provides for the court to award \"injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief in order to protect the\\npeaceable exercise or enjoyment of the right or rights secured [by the constitution].\" G.L. c. 12, §11I contains\\nremedies similar to §11H.\\n66. The previous limit of $1,000 punitive damages under Title VIII was eliminated in 1988. The court is now authorized\\nto award punitive damages in whatever amount is appropriate. See 42 U.S.C. §3613(c)(1). Since 1988, punitive\\ndamage awards under Title VIII have sometimes been very high. See Littlefield v. McGuffey, 954 F.2d 1337, 1348-50\\n146 ▲ Chapter 7: Discrimination\\n\\n(7th Cir. 1992) (upholding jury award of $100,000 to single plaintiff). Guidance regarding the size of an appropriate\\naward should be sought from 42 U.S.C. §§1981 and 1982 cases which were not constrained by the previous\\nlimitation. See Marable v. Walker, 704 F.2d 1219, 1220-21 (11th Cir. 1983); Phillips v. Hunter Trails Community Ass\\'n,\\n685 F.2d 184, 190-91 (7th Cir. 1982).\\nG.L. c. 151B, §9 authorizes the court to award actual and punitive damages. For the conduct that will justify the\\naward of punitive damages, see Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts\\n§908(1) (1979) (§1983 case)). See also Newport v.

Hunter Trails Community Ass\\'n, 685 F.2d 184, 191 (7th Cir. 1982) (decided that the most important issue in\\ndeciding whether to award punitive damages is whether the defendant\\'s actions were intentional). The size of the\\naward should serve the twin goals of deterrence and punishment, and therefore the defendant\\'s financial resources\\nare relevant. See, e.g., Miller v. Apartments and Homes of N.J., Inc., 646 F.2d 101, 111 (3d Cir. 1981).\\n68. Phillips v. Hunter Trails Community Ass\\'n, 685 F.2d 184, 191 (7th Cir. 1982); Grayson v. S.

If the respondent has not been adjudged to have committed any discriminating housing practice during the last five\\nyears, the civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000.

Shea, Hampden Housing Court, CA-90-CV-0022-H (Order of March 8, 1990), where the receiver,\\nV.P.M., Inc., was paid 6% of the collected rents over and above its out-of-pocket expenses, but only after securing\\nvacant units and making emergency repairs.\\n91. Pursuant to G.L. C. 111, §127I, receivers can have a lien with priority over all other liens except municipal liens.\\nSuch liens may be assigned to lenders for purposes of securing loans for repairs, operations, maintenance, and\\nmanagement of priority. See also Turner v. State Wharf and Storage Co., 263 Mass. 92 (1928).\\n92. In Lowell, the Coalition for a Better Acre, a nonprofit community development corporation, when seeking\\nfinancing for the redevelopment of a 267-unit subsidized apartment complex, was instrumental in creating the\\nLowell Development Financial Corporation (LDFC), which set up a special loan pool to increase affordable\\nhousing development in Lowell. Start-up funds for LDFC came from nine local banks. For information about how\\nthe loan pool was set up, see Everybody in the Pool, HOUSING MATTERS, Vol. 4, #3 (December 1990), published\\nby the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute.\\n93. In Garcia v. Shea (endnote 90), Mena v. Shapiro (endnote 87), and Cardona v. Sheedy, Hampden Housing Court, CA-91-\\nCV 0181 (September 10, 1991), mortgagees of the properties involved agreed to advance to the receivership money\\nfor repairs to the extent rent money collected was insufficient. Depending upon the language of the bank\\'s\\nmortgage agreement with the landlord, money given by the bank to the receiver may be added to the landlord\\'s\\nmortgage and may have the same priority as the bank\\'s original mortgage.\\n94. In Olde Holyoke Dev. Corp. v. Morales, Hampden Housing Court 90 SP 01291 H (July 3, 1990), the court held that,\\npursuant to Chapter 898 of the Acts of 1965, Section 4, as amended by Chapter 404 of the Acts of 1968, Section 1\\n(approved June 18, 1968) after a receivership ends, for nine months following the receivership, the new owner was\\nprohibited from terminating the tenancy without a reason. The reasoning of this decision would presumably also\\nprohibit rent increases during this nine-month period.\\n95. Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended, 12 U.S.C. §§2901 et seq.

For more about federal CRA history, regulations, and how to access CRA lending\\ninformation, see the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council website at\\nhttp://www.ffiec.gov/cra/default.htm.\\nYou may want to call the bank and ask to speak with its Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) officer. Every bank\\nappoints an officer to monitor compliance with the CRA. If a bank has been unresponsive to your requests for\\nassistance, you may want to write a letter to the bank, outlining all of the relevant facts and specifically stating what\\nyou would like the bank to do. At the end of the letter, ask the bank to \"include your letter in their Community\\nReinvestment Act Public Comment File.\" As a result of making this request, the bank will be required to show your\\nletter to government officials who monitor the bank\\'s compliance with this law. You may also want to send a copy\\nof your letter to the monitoring agency. Remember to keep a copy of the letter for future reference.\\n96. In Fitchburg, tenants of the Harris receivership, [Harris v. Houde, Worcester Housing Court, CA-90-CV-0052-H\\n(Order of February 28, 1990)], worked closely with city officials in their efforts to get the bank to deal with three\\nproperties for which it held mortgages; the Fitchburg Board of Health pursued the bank by issuing correction\\norders regarding the properties; the Planning Department pursued contacts with bank officials in the unrealized\\nChapter 8: Getting Repairs Made ▲ 177\\n\\nhopes of negotiating the properties\\' sale to the CDC; and the mayor wrote a letter to the bank, attaching a local\\npaper\\'s editorial condemning the bank\\'s inaction.\\n97. 105 C.M.R. §410.831.
