## Overview

_The goal of the project is to design and prototype an AI-powered legal assistance chatbot tailored for individuals facing eviction and other housing-related legal issues. The chatbot should use (large language models) LLMs to provide end users with accurate legal information, assist in drafting legal pleadings, and guide them through court processes. As a team we will train and test LLMs on the curated datasets provided to us by the client that are credible legal sources (eg: MassLegalHelp.org) and evaluate the chatbot's response for accuracy with the 2L students assigned to this project._

### A. Provide a solution in terms of human actions to confirm if the task is within the scope of automation through AI.

*To assist in outlining the steps needed to achieve our final goal, outline the AI-less process that we are trying to automate with Machine Learning. Provide as much detail as possible.*


### B. Problem Statement:

*In as direct terms as possible, provide the “Data Science” or "Machine Learning" problem statement version of the overview. Think of this as translating the above into a more technical definition to execute on. eg: a classification problem to segregate users into one of three groups on based on the historical user data available from a publicly available database*

### C. Checklist for project completion

*Provide a bulleted list to the best of your current understanding, of the concrete techinal goals and artifacts that, when complete, define the completion of the project. This checklist will likely evolve as your project progresses.*

1. Deliverable 1
2. Deliverable 2

### D. Outline a path to operationalization.

*Data Science Projects should have an operationalized end point in mind from the onset. Briefly describe how you see the tool produced by this project being used by the end user beyond a jupyter notebook or proof of concept. If possible, be specific and call out the relevant technologies that will be useful when making this available to the stakeholders as a final deliverable.*
