# Technical Project Document Template

## *Authors, 20xx-Month-Day vx.x.x-dev*

## Overview

_In this document, based on the available project outline and summary of the project pitch, to the best of your abilities, you will come up with the technical plan or goals for implementing the project such that it best meets the stakeholder requirements._

### A. Provide a solution in terms of human actions to confirm if the task is within the scope of automation through AI.

*To assist in outlining the steps needed to achieve our final goal, outline the AI-less process that we are trying to automate with Machine Learning. Provide as much detail as possible.*

### B. Problem Statement:

Develop and evaluate an NLP-driven legal chatbot for eviction and housing-related queries. Fine-tune LLMs on curated legal datasets to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses, assessed using benchmark metrics and expert validation.

### C. Checklist for project completion

Checklist for Project Completion
1. Proof of Concept (PoC) Deployment
- AI-powered legal assistance chatbot hosted on Hugging Face.

2. Code and Data Management

- All source code uploaded to GitHub and Google Drive.
- Cleaned and processed datasets stored in the designated Google Drive folder.
- Code scripts for data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization included.

3. A Presentation with: 
- Summary of How the LLM Works: Basic explanation of the LLM architecture and fine-tuning process.
    - Focus on how it was tailored for the chatbotâ€™s specific use case.
- Findings on LLM Accuracy: Highlight key accuracy metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).
    - Statistics and Visualizations: Graphs/tables showing model performance.
- Future Development Recommendations
    - Suggestions for scaling, integrating new datasets, or expanding functionality.
    - Methods to improve response accuracy and mitigate errors.

### D. Outline a path to operationalization.

*Data Science Projects should have an operationalized end point in mind from the onset. Briefly describe how you see the tool produced by this project being used by the end user beyond a jupyter notebook or proof of concept. If possible, be specific and call out the relevant technologies that will be useful when making this available to the stakeholders as a final deliverable.*
