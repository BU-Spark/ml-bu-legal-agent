    "section_text": "Section 15B: Entrance of premises prior to termination of lease; payments; receipts; interest; records; security deposits\nSection 15B. (1) (a) No lease relating to residential real property shall contain a provision that a lessor may, except to inspect the premises, to make repairs thereto or to show the same to a prospective tenant, purchaser, mortgagee or its agents, enter the premises before the termination date of such lease. A lessor may, however, enter such premises:\n(i) in accordance with a court order;\n(ii) if the premises appear to have been abandoned by the lessee; or\n(iii) to inspect, within the last thirty days of the tenancy or after either party has given notice to the other of intention to terminate the tenancy, the premises for the purpose of determining the amount of damage, if any, to the premises which would be cause for deduction from any security deposit held by the lessor pursuant to this section.\n(b) At or prior to the commencement of any tenancy, no lessor may require a tenant or prospective tenant to pay any amount in excess of the following:\n(i) rent for the first full month of occupancy; and,\n(ii) rent for the last full month of occupancy calculated at the same rate as the first month; and,\n(iii) a security deposit equal to the first month's rent provided that such security deposit is deposited as required by subsection (3) and that the tenant is given the statement of condition as required by subsection (2); and,\n(iv) the purchase and installation cost for a key and lock.\n(c) No lease or other rental agreement shall impose any interest or penalty for failure to pay rent until thirty days after such rent shall have been due.\n(d) No lessor or successor in interest shall at any time subsequent to the commencement of a tenancy demand rent in advance in excess of the current month's rent or a security deposit in excess of the amount allowed by this section. The payment in advance for occupancy pursuant to this section shall be binding upon all successors in interest.\n(b) Any lessor or his agent who receives a security deposit from a tenant or prospective tenant shall give said tenant or prospective tenant at the time of receiving such security deposit a receipt indicating the amount of such security deposit, the name of the person receiving it and, in the case of an agent, the name of the lessor for whom such security deposit is received, the date on which it is received, and a description of the premises leased or rented. Said receipt shall be signed by the person receiving the security deposit.\n(c) Any lessor of residential real property, or his agent, who accepts a security deposit from a tenant or prospective tenant shall, upon receipt of such security deposit, or within ten days after commencement of the tenancy, whichever is later, furnish to such tenant or prospective tenant a separate written statement of the present condition of the premises to be leased or rented. Such written statement shall also contain a comprehensive listing of any damage then existing in the premises, including, but not limited to, any violations of the state sanitary or state building codes certified by a local board of health or building official or adjudicated by a court and then existing in the premises. Such statement shall be signed by the lessor or his agent and contain the following notice in twelve-point bold-face type at the top of the first page thereof:\n''This is a statement of the condition of the premises you have leased or rented. You should read it carefully in order to see if it is correct. If it is correct you must sign it. This will show that you agree that the list is correct and complete. If it is not correct, you must attach a separate signed list of any damage which you believe exists in the premises. This statement must be returned to the lessor or his agent within fifteen days after you receive this list or within fifteen days after you move in, whichever is later. If you do not return this list, within the specified time period, a court may later view your failure to return the list as your agreement that the list is complete and correct in any suit which you may bring to recover the security deposit.''\nIf the tenant submits to the lessor or his agent a separate list of damages, the lessor or his agent shall, within fifteen days of receiving said separate list, return a copy of said list to the tenant with either such lessor's signed agreement with the content thereof or a clear statement of disagreement attached.\n(d) Every lessor who accepts a security deposit shall maintain a record of all such security deposits received which contains the following information:—\n(i) a detailed description of any damage done to each of the dwelling units or premises for which a security deposit has been accepted, returned to any tenant thereof or for which the lessor has brought suit against any tenant;\n(ii) the date upon which the occupancy of the tenant or tenants charged with such damage was terminated; and\n(iii) whether repairs were performed to remedy such damage, the dates of said repairs, the cost thereof, and receipts therefor.\nSaid record shall also include copies of any receipt or statement of condition given to a tenant or prospective tenant as required by this section.\nThe lessor or his agent shall maintain said record for each dwelling unit or premises for which a security deposit was accepted for a period of two years from the date of termination of the tenancy or occupancy upon which the security deposit was conditioned.\n(4) The lessor shall, within thirty days after the termination of occupancy under a tenancy-at-will or the end of the tenancy as specified in a valid written lease agreement, return to the tenant the security deposit or any balance thereof; provided, however, that the lessor may deduct from such security deposit for the following:\n(i) any unpaid rent or water charges which have not been validly withheld or deducted pursuant to any general or special law\n(ii) any unpaid increase in real estate taxes which the tenant is obligated to pay pursuant to a tax escalation clause which conforms to the requirements of section fifteen C; and\n(iii) a reasonable amount necessary to repair any damage caused to the dwelling unit by the tenant or any person under the tenant's control or on the premises with the tenant's consent, reasonable wear and tear excluded. In the case of such damage, the lessor shall provide to the tenant within such thirty days an itemized list of damages, sworn to by the lessor or his agent under pains and penalties of perjury, itemizing in precise detail the nature of the damage and of the repairs necessary to correct such damage, and written evidence, such as estimates, bills, invoices or receipts, indicating the actual or estimated cost thereof. No amount shall be deducted from the security deposit for any damage to the dwelling unit which was listed in the separate written statement of the present condition of the premises which was required to be given to the tenant prior to the execution of the lease or creation of the tenancy pursuant to clause (c) of subsection (2) or any damages listed in any separate list submitted by the tenant and signed by the lessor or his agent pursuant to said clause (c), unless the lessor subsequently repaired or caused to be repaired said damage and can prove that the renewed damage was unrelated to the prior damage and was caused by the tenant or by any person under the tenant's control or on the premises with the tenant's consent. Nothing in this section shall limit the right of a landlord to recover from a tenant, who wilfully or maliciously destroys or damages the real or personal property of said landlord, to the forfeiture of a security deposit, when the cost of repairing or replacing such property exceeds the amount of such security deposit.\nNo deduction may be made from the security deposit for any purpose other than those set forth in this section.\n(5) Whenever a lessor who receives a security deposit transfers his interest in the dwelling unit for which the security deposit is held, whether by sale, assignment, death, appointment of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, or otherwise, the lessor shall transfer such security deposit together with any interest which has accrued thereon for the benefit of the tenant who made such security deposit to his successor in interest, and said successor in interest shall be liable for the retention and return of said security deposit in accordance with the provisions of this section from the date upon which said transfer is made; provided however, that the granting of a mortgage on such premises shall not be a transfer of interest. The successor in interest shall, within forty-five days from the date of said transfer, notify the tenant who made such security deposit that such security deposit was transferred to him and that he is holding said security deposit. Such notice shall also contain the lessor's name, business address, and business telephone number, and the name, business address, and business telephone number of his agent, if any. Said notice shall be in writing.\nUpon such transfer, the lessor or his agent shall continue to be liable with respect to the provisions of this section until:\n(a) there has been a transfer of the amount of the security deposit so held to the lessor's successor in interest and the tenant has been notified in writing of the transfer and of the successor in interest's name, business address, and business telephone number;\n(b) there has been compliance with this clause by the successor in interest; or\n(c) the security deposit has been returned to the tenant.\n(6) The lessor shall forfeit his right to retain any portion of the security deposit for any reason, or, in any action by a tenant to recover a security deposit, to counterclaim for any damage to the premises if he:\n(a) fails to deposit such funds in an account as required by subsection (3);\n(b) fails to furnish to the tenant within thirty days after the termination of the occupancy the itemized list of damages, if any, in compliance with the provisions of this section;\n(c) uses in any lease signed by the tenant any provision which conflicts with any provision of this section and attempts to enforce such provision or attempts to obtain from the tenant or prospective tenant a waiver of any provision of this section;\n(d) fails to transfer such security deposit to his successor in interest or to otherwise comply with the provisions of subsection (5) after he has succeeded to an interest in residential real property; or,\n(7A) Whenever a lessor who receives rent in advance for the last month of tenancy transfers his interest in the dwelling unit for which the rental advance was received, whether by sale, assignment, death, appointment of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, or otherwise, the lessor shall credit an amount equal to such rental advance together with any interest which has accrued thereon for the benefit of the tenant who made such rental advance, to the successor in interest of such lessor, and said successor in interest shall be liable for crediting the tenant with such rental advance, and for paying all interest accrued thereon in accordance with the provisions of this section from the date upon which said transfer is made; provided, however, that the granting of a mortgage on such premises shall not be deemed a transfer of interest. The successor in interest shall, within forty-five days from the date of said transfer, notify the tenant who made such rental advance that such rental advance was so credited, and that such successor has assumed responsibility therefor pursuant to the foregoing provision. Such notice shall also contain the lessor's name, business address, and business telephone number, and the name, business address, and business telephone number of his agent, if any. Said notice shall be in writing.\nUpon such transfer, the lessor or his agent shall continue to be liable with respect to the provisions of this section until:—(a) there has been a credit of the amount of the rental advance so held to the lessor's successor in interest and the tenant has been notified in writing of the transfer and of the successor in interest's name, business address, and business telephone number; (b) there has been compliance with this clause by the successor in interest; or (c) the rental advance has been credited to the tenant and all accrued interest has been paid thereon.\n(8) Any provision of a lease which conflicts with any provision of this section and any waiver by a tenant or prospective tenant of any provision of this section shall be deemed to be against public policy and therefore void and unenforceable.\n(9) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any lease, rental, occupancy or tenancy of one hundred days or less in duration which lease or rental is for a vacation or recreational purpose."

    "section_text": "Section 22: Definitions; submeter installation; testing; water use charges; public housing development exemption\nSection 22. (a) For the purposes of this section the following words shall have the following meanings:—\n''Common area'', any portion of a building with more than 1 dwelling unit that is not incorporated within a dwelling unit.\n''Customer service charge'', a fixed amount charged by a city or town or water company for providing water to a building.\n''Dwelling unit'', any house or building, or portion thereof, that is occupied, designed to be occupied, or is rented, leased or hired out to be occupied, as a home or residence of one or more persons.\n''Landlord'', the owner, lessor or sublessor of a dwelling unit, the building of which it is a part, or the premises wherein a customer receives water service through metered measurement.\n''Submetering'', use of a meter by a landlord who receives water from a water company, which meter measures water supplied to a dwelling unit to enable the landlord to charge the tenant of the dwelling unit separately for water usage, or which meter measures water supplied to a common area.\n''Water conservation device'', for all showers, shower stalls, shower compartments or shower baths, a low-flow showerhead which shall have a maximum flow rate not exceeding 2 1/2 gallons of water per minute, for all faucets a maximum flow rate not exceeding 2 and 2/10 gallons of water per minute and for all water closets, ultra-low-flush water closets not exceeding 1 and 6/10 gallons of water per flush, contained within a dwelling unit.\n(b) A landlord may cause to be installed by a plumber licensed in the commonwealth, at the expense of such landlord, submetering equipment in the landlord's building to measure the quantity of water provided for the exclusive use of each dwelling unit, provided that such equipment meets the standards of accuracy and testing of the American Water Works Association or a similar accredited association; and provided further, that a submeter is installed for each dwelling unit in the building and for the common areas of the building, so that all water used in a building is measured by both a primary meter and a submeter.\n(c) A landlord may charge a tenant of a dwelling unit for water usage as measured through the use of submetering equipment only in accordance with this section and only upon the landlord certifying that the dwelling unit is in compliance with this section to a board of health, health department or other municipal agency or department charged with enforcement of the state sanitary code. All provisions of this section allowing landlords to charge tenants for water usage shall also be deemed to apply to sewer service charges calculated by means of the same primary meter or submeter. Certification by the landlord shall be provided under the penalties of perjury and shall include a statement that: 1) the dwelling unit is eligible for the imposition on the tenant of a charge for water usage in accordance with paragraph (d); 2) all showerheads, faucets, and water closets in the dwelling unit are water conservation devices and that all water closets were installed by a licensed plumber; and 3) the water submeter measuring the use of water in the dwelling unit was installed by a licensed plumber and is in compliance with the standards of accuracy and testing referenced in subsection (b).\n(e) A landlord may not charge the tenant of a dwelling unit separately for water usage measured by a submeter, nor allow such tenant to be so charged, unless the submeter measures only water that is supplied for the exclusive use of the particular dwelling unit and only to an area within the exclusive possession and control of the tenant of such dwelling unit and does not measure any water usage for any portion of the common areas or by any other party or dwelling unit; provided further, that a landlord shall not charge such tenant for water supplied through a submeter to the dwelling unit prior to the landlord installing fully functional water conservation devices for all faucets, showerheads and water closets in the dwelling unit; and provided further, that the landlord shall ensure that such water conservation devices are installed and functioning properly at the commencement of each subsequent tenancy in such dwelling unit.\n(f) A landlord may not charge the tenant separately, nor allow tenant to be charged separately, for submetered water usage unless the tenant has signed a written rental agreement that clearly and conspicuously provides for such separate charge and that fully discloses in plain language the details of the water submetering and billing arrangement between the landlord and the tenant. Each bill for submetered water usage shall clearly set forth all charges and all other relevant information, including, but not limited to, the current and immediately preceding submeter readings and the date of each such reading, the amount of water consumed since the last reading, the charge per unit of water, the total charge and the payment due date. Such charges shall be billed to the tenant in at leased as many periods as the landlord is billed by the water company providing such water to the building or such payments may be made on a monthly payment schedule as agreed to in the written rental agreement; provided, however, that if the landlord bills the tenant on a monthly basis, payment of the bill by the tenant shall be due 15 days after the date the bill is mailed to the tenant, but if the landlord bills the tenant at intervals greater than 1 month, payment of the bill by the tenant shall be due 30 days after the date the bill is mailed to the tenant. If the tenant fails to make such payment, such nonpayment shall be a material breach of the written rental agreement. Violation of such breach may be cured by payment of the water charges in full prior to any court hearing to adjudicate such violation.\n(g) A landlord shall determine a calculated cost per unit of water consumption by dividing the total amount of any bill or invoice provided to the landlord from the water company for water usage, the customer service charge and taxes, but not including any interest for the late payment, penalty fees or other discretionary assessments or charges, for all water provided to the premises through the water company meter in that billing period, by the total amount of water consumption for the entire premises. The total amount charged separately to each submetered dwelling unit for water usage for any billing period shall not exceed such calculated cost per unit of water multiplied by the number of units of water delivered exclusively to the particular dwelling unit for the same billing period, provided that the landlord has verified that the total amounts of water usage measured by all submeters in the building, including all submeters for common areas, does not exceed the total amount of water usage in the building for the same billing period as shown on such bill or invoice.\n(h) Whenever a tenancy in a dwelling unit commences after the beginning, but before the end, of a billing period for which the landlord has not been billed by the water company, the landlord shall mail to the tenant on the first day of such tenancy the reading on the submeter for the dwelling unit as of that day. The landlord may thereafter bill the tenant only for the water measured on the submeter subsequent to such reading.\n(j) A landlord shall not charge or recover, or allow to be charged or recovered, any additional servicing, administrative, establishment, meter-reading, meter-testing, billing, or submetering fee or other fee whatsoever, however denominated.\n(k) Water usage separately charged to tenants pursuant to this section shall be delivered by the water company to the landlord and such landlord shall:— (1) be the consumer; (2) for billing purposes, be the customer of record; (3) be responsible for payment of the water company bills; and (4) be subject to any actions of the water company for nonpayment.\n(l) In the event of nonpayment of a bill to a water company by the landlord, such water company shall have all the remedies against the customer of the water company available pursuant to any law, rule or regulation. A landlord may not shut off or refuse water service to a tenant on the basis that the tenant has not paid a separately assessed submetered water usage charge.\n(o) In the event of a repair of a leak in the water supply system to a dwelling unit, the landlord shall determine as accurately as possible the amount of water that was measured on the submeter for the dwelling unit as a result of such leak, after a review of the billing records for the dwelling unit and consultation with the licensed plumber repairing the leak. The landlord shall then determine the amount of the bill for the billing period in which the leak occurred that was attributable to such leak and reduce the bill to the tenant by that amount or, if such bill has already been paid, grant the tenant a rebate in that amount; provided, however, that with regard to any leak about which the tenant knew or should have known, the landlord shall only be required to reduce the bill to the tenant, or to grant a rebate to the tenant, by or in an amount attributable to the water usage measured on the submeter as a result of the leak between the date the tenant gave notice to the landlord of the leak and the date the leak was repaired.\n(q) Nothing in this section shall be construed to increase or expand, change, eliminate, reduce or otherwise limit the liabilities or obligations of any water company that are set forth in any law, rule, regulation or order to the tenant of a dwelling unit who is receiving water provided to the building by the water company.\n(t) The department of public health shall promulgate such additional regulations to the state sanitary code as it determines to be necessary to implement this section."

The notice referred to in this section shall be served in the same manner as the summary process summons and complaint and shall be filed in the court that issued the execution.\nThe officer shall select the public warehouser identified in the notice described in the preceding paragraph in a manner calculated to ensure that the defendant's personal property will be stored within a reasonable distance of the premises at issue in the summary process action. The officer shall not select pursuant to this section a warehouser whom the officer knows or reasonably believes to be in violation of any provision of section 4.\nNo execution for possession of premises rented or leased for dwelling purposes shall be served or levied upon after five o'clock p.m. or before nine o'clock a.m., nor on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.\nIf the underlying money judgment in any summary process action for nonpayment of rent in premises rented or leased for dwelling purposes has been fully satisfied, together with any use and occupancy accruing since the date of judgment, the plaintiff shall be barred from levying on any execution for possession that has issued and shall return the execution to the court fully satisfied. If no execution has issued, the plaintiff shall notify the court of the satisfaction of judgment and no execution shall issue thereafter. If the underlying money judgment has been fully satisfied and use and occupancy fully paid, the defendant shall be considered a lawful tenant and may enforce this right through judicial process, including injunctions barring the issuance of or levying upon the execution and motions to supersede or recall the execution. Notwithstanding this paragraph, the plaintiff shall not be required to accept full satisfaction of the money judgment. Any refusal by the plaintiff to accept full satisfaction of the money judgment under this paragraph shall not be a bar to the enforcement of said judgment in any lawful manner.\nIn case of appeal from the district court on either or both issues involved or on any counterclaim, the appeal shall be to the appellate division under section 5."

A housing authority shall not undertake a low-rent housing project until it has submitted to the department the plans and description of the project, the estimated cost thereof, the proposed method of financing it, and a detailed estimate of the expenses and revenues thereof and the department has found that the plans and description conform to proper standards of health, sanitation and safety.\nIn addition, the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall apply to all state aided low-income projects:\n(a) Projects involving the purchase or acquisition of the right to use completed dwelling units which have been recently constructed, reconstructed or remodeled, whether condominium units, individual buildings part of a larger development, or a portion of the units in a multi-family development, shall be approved by the department only after it makes the following determinations: (i) the number of units involved, other than units specifically to be used for elderly persons of low income, does not exceed one hundred in any one building or development; and (ii) the housing authority has made adequate arrangements for the maintenance and operation of the units, either through use of its own personnel or by contract with a private real estate management organization acceptable to the local housing authority with the approval of the department.\n(b) Projects involving the construction of new buildings by a housing authority shall be approved by the department following due notice and a public hearing in the town or city involved held to consider testimony relating to the determinations required to be made. The department shall approve such a project only if it makes the following determinations: (i) the design and layout of the proposed project is appropriate to the neighborhood in which it is to be located; and (ii) an adequate supply of dwelling units for low-income families is not then available in the private market and the housing authority, after reasonable effort, has been unable to obtain such units either through reconstruction, remodeling or repair of existing buildings or by the purchase of completed dwelling units. The provisions of this clause shall not apply to any project which shall be certified by the department to be a project designed specifically for elderly persons of low income. A project shall be deemed to be designed specifically for elderly persons of low income if a majority of the dwelling units in said project are designed specifically for elderly persons of low income and if not more than one hundred dwelling units in said project are designed for families of low income.\nThe department shall give written notice to the authority of its decision with respect to any project within thirty days after submission of such project. The department shall hold a public hearing upon any project, if requested in writing so to do, within ten days after the submission of the project, by the housing authority, or by the mayor or city council of the city or the selectmen of the town in which the proposed project is located, or by twenty-five or more taxable inhabitants of such city or town. Such public hearing may be combined with that required under subparagraph (b) in the case of projects approved under that subparagraph. No such hearing shall be held on any day on which a state or municipal election, caucus or primary is held in such city or town. If the department shall disapprove any project, it shall state in writing in such notice its reason for disapproval.\nA project which has not been approved by the department when submitted to it may be again submitted to it with such modifications as are necessary to meet its objections.\nWhen a housing authority has determined the location of a proposed clearance or low-rent housing project, it may, without awaiting the approval of the department, proceed by option or otherwise, to obtain control of the real property to be acquired for the project; provided, however, that it shall not, without the approval of the department, unconditionally obligate itself to acquire such real estate. When a housing authority receives notice that such a project has been approved by the department, it may proceed to acquire real estate for the project, and may construct, or contract for the construction of, any buildings and facilities planned therefor."

The department shall adopt regulations which shall require disqualification of an applicant for housing developed pursuant to sections thirty-four, thirty-nine and forty for reasons, absent outweighing mitigating circumstances, including the following:\n(a) The applicant or a household member has disturbed a neighbor or neighbors in a prior residence by behavior, which if repeated by a tenant in public housing, would substantially interfere with the rights of other tenants to peaceful enjoyment of their units.\n(b) The applicant or a household member has caused damage or destruction of property at a prior residence, and such damage or destruction, if repeated by a tenant in public housing, would have a material adverse effect on the housing development or any unit in such development.\n(c) The applicant or a household member has displayed living habits or poor housekeeping at a prior residence, and such living habits or poor housekeeping, if repeated by a tenant in public housing, would pose a substantial threat to the health or safety of the tenant or other tenants or would adversely affect the decent, safe and sanitary condition of all or part of the housing.\n(e) The applicant or any household member who will be assuming part of the rent obligation has a history of non-payment of rent and such non-payment, if repeated by a tenant in public housing, would cause monetary loss; provided, however, that if the tenant paid at least fifty percent of his household's monthly income for rent each month during a tenancy but was unable to pay the full rent, an eviction for non-payment of the balance of the rent shall not disqualify such individual from public housing pursuant to this paragraph.\n(f) The applicant or a household member has a history of failure to meet material lease terms or the equivalent at one or more prior residences, and such failure if repeated by a tenant of public housing, would be detrimental to the housing authority or to the health, safety, security or peaceful enjoyment of other tenants.\n(g) The applicant has failed to provide information reasonably necessary for the housing authority to process the applicant's application.\n(h) The applicant has misrepresented or falsified any information required to be submitted as part of the applicant's application, and the applicant fails to establish that the misrepresentation or falsification was unintentional.\n(i) The applicant or any household member does not intend to occupy public housing, if offered, as his primary residence.\nThe regulations shall also provide that prior to disqualifying an applicant for any of the reasons for disqualification set forth above, the housing authority shall permit the applicant to show whether there are mitigating circumstances, which may include a showing of rehabilitation or rehabilitating efforts, sufficient so that when the potentially disqualifying conduct is weighed against the mitigating circumstances, the housing authority is reasonably certain that the applicant will not engage in any similar conduct in the future. In making this determination, the housing authority shall consider all relevant circumstances, including the severity of the potentially disqualifying conduct, the amount of time which has elapsed since the occurrence of such conduct, the degree of danger, if any, to the health, safety and security of others or to the security of the property of others or to the physical conditions of the housing development and its common areas if the conduct recurred, the disruption and inconvenience which recurrence would cause the housing authority, and the likelihood that the applicant's behavior in the future will be substantially improved. The greater the degree of danger, if any, to the health, safety and security of others or to the security of property of others or the physical condition of the housing, the greater must be the strength of the showing that a recurrence of behavior, which would have been disqualifying, will not occur in the future."

No notes may be issued on account of any project which cause the total amount of notes outstanding for that project, exclusive of notes which may be issued for refunding purposes, to exceed the amount of grant to be received thereafter under the contract relating thereto.\nNotwithstanding the provisions of section seventeen the payment of the principal of, and interest on, all such notes shall be guaranteed by the commonwealth, and the full faith and credit of the commonwealth is hereby pledged for any such guarantee.

The time periods set forth in this subsection may be extended by agreement between the owner and the department. The proposed purchase contract shall contain the same terms and conditions as the executed third party purchase contract, except that the proposed purchase contract shall provide at least the following terms: (i) the earnest money deposit shall not exceed the lesser of: (1) the deposit in the third party purchase contract; (2) 2 per cent of the sale price; or (3) $250,000; provided, however, that the owner and the department may agree to modify the terms of the earnest money deposit; and provided further, that the earnest money deposit shall be held under commercially-reasonable terms by an escrow agent selected jointly by the owner and the department; (ii) the earnest money deposit shall be refundable for not less than 90 days from the date of execution of the purchase contract or such greater period as provided for in the third party purchase contract; provided, however, that if the owner unreasonably delays the buyer's ability to conduct due diligence during the 90 day period, the earnest money deposit shall continue to be refundable for a period greater than 90 days; and (iii) the time for performance shall be not less than 240 days from the date of the execution of the purchase contract, or such greater period as provided for in the third party purchase contract.\n(d) If the department executes the proposed purchase contract as provided in subsection (b) but fails to perform as provided in the executed purchase contract, then the owner shall have 2 years from the date on which the executed purchase contract terminated in which to complete a sale of the owner's publicly-assisted housing to a third party. Upon the expiration of the 2–year period, the owner shall be subject again to all of subsection (c) of section 2, section 3 and this section.\n(e) After receipt of the third party purchase contract provided for in subsection (b), the department may, within the 30–day time period prescribed in said subsection (b), make a counteroffer by executing and submitting to the owner an amended proposed purchase contract. Failure by the department to execute the purchase contract or submit a counteroffer within the 30–day period referenced in subsection (b) shall constitute a waiver of the department's right to purchase under this section. If the department submits a counteroffer, the owner shall have 30 days from the date it receives the amended proposed purchase contract to execute the amended proposed purchase contract or reject, in writing, the counteroffer. If the owner rejects the counteroffer, the owner shall have 2 years from the date on which the owner rejects the department's counteroffer to complete a sale of the publicly-assisted housing to a third party; provided, however, that if such sale is upon economic terms and conditions that are the same as or materially more favorable to the proposed purchaser than the economic terms and conditions in the proposed purchase contract offered by the department in its counteroffer, the owner shall provide a copy of the new third party purchase contract, along with a proposed purchase contract for execution by the department which shall contain the same terms and conditions as the executed third party purchase contract; provided that the department shall have 30 days from the date it receives the third party purchase contract and the proposed purchase contract to execute the proposed purchase contract or such other agreement as is acceptable to the owner and the department.\n(f) The owner shall, not later than 7 days after the execution of a purchase contract with a third party, provide the department with a copy of any new or amended purchase contract executed with respect to the property during the 2 year period set forth in subsections (c) to (e), inclusive, and shall not later than 7 days after the recording or filing of the deed or other document with the registry of deeds or the registry district of the land court of the county in which the affected real property is located, provide the department with a copy of any such deed or other document transferring the owner's interest in the publicly-assisted housing.\n(g) Any third party purchase contract, amended third party purchase contract, deed or any other document transferring the owner's interest in publicly-assisted housing shall include a certification by the owner that the document is accurate and complete and there are no other agreements between the owner and the third party buyer, or an affiliate of either, with respect to the sale of the publicly-assisted housing."

    "section_text": "Section 5S: Public bathing waters; minimum sanitation standards; testing, monitoring and analysis; regulations\nSection 5S. (a) As used in this section, the following words shall have the following meanings:—\n''Bathing water'', fresh or salt water adjacent to any public bathing beach or semi-public bathing beach in the commonwealth.\n''Department'', the department of public health.\n''Public bathing beach'', a beach open to the general public, whether or not an entry fee is charged, that permits access to bathing waters.\n''Semi-public bathing beach'', a bathing beach used in connection with a hotel, motel, trailer park, campground, apartment house, condominium, country club, youth club, school, camp or similar establishment where the primary purpose of the establishment is not the operation of the bathing beach, and where admission to the use of the bathing beach is included in the fee paid for use of the premises. A semi-public bathing beach shall also include a bathing beach operated and maintained solely for the use of members and guests of an organization that maintains such a bathing beach.\n(b) The department, in consultation with local health officers, shall establish minimum sanitation standards to protect bathing waters from contamination from the following: (1) sludge deposits and solid refuse; (2) floating solid, grease or scum wastes; (3) oil, hazardous material, and heavy metals; and (4) bacteria, including but not limited to, total coliform, fecal coliform and enterococci bacteria.\n(c) Such standards shall establish safe levels of human exposure to such contaminants, and shall further incorporate, at a minimum, the following provisions:—\n(1) An officer or an agent of a local board of health shall test, monitor and analyze all bathing waters within its municipality. Every local board of health shall report the results from all testing, monitoring and analysis of bathing waters to the department. The department shall establish such reporting requirements and shall keep public records thereof. The department shall issue an annual report on the state of beach water quality using data that has been reported to the department. The department shall make such data available to the public upon written request.\n(2) The department shall determine at which sites to conduct testing and monitoring of bathing waters. The department shall consider, but not be limited to, the following factors in determining at which sites to conduct testing and monitoring of bathing waters: (i) prior testing results pursuant to this section for such bathing waters; (ii) the number of people who use the bathing beach annually; and (iii) whether the beach is located adjacent to a storm water drain, sewage, industrial and commercial wastewater discharges, or commercial, industrial and agricultural drains.\n(d) The department shall determine at what frequency to conduct testing, monitoring and analysis of bathing waters. Testing, monitoring and analysis shall be conducted on at least a weekly basis during the bathing season, and at such times and under such conditions as shall be sufficient to protect public health and safety. The department may grant a variance from the weekly testing requirement for a public or semi-public bathing beach only where there is a documented history of no sources of pollution, both point and non-point, at the bathing beach, or where such pollution sources at the beach have been fully and completely remediated.\n(e) The department shall require the posting of conspicuous warning signs to notify the public whenever there is a threat to human health or safety in bathing waters. Signs shall be posted at locations on the beach that are visible to the public in order to inform the public of the nature of the problem and the possibility of a threat to human health and safety. Signs shall be posted immediately after significant rainstorms at bathing beach locations where there has been a chronic history of violations of the department's minimum sanitation standards for bathing beaches after such rainstorms. When an officer or agent of a local board of health discovers a violation of such minimum sanitation standards, the officer or agent shall notify the department immediately, and in no event not later than 24 hours after such discovery. The local board of health shall also post signs immediately, and in no event not later than 24 hours after such a discovery.\n(f) A person may request that a local board of health conduct testing, monitoring and analysis of bathing waters when there is a reasonable basis to believe that an alleged violation of such minimum sanitation standards established by this section has occurred. Local boards of health shall promptly review such requests and determine whether any such testing, monitoring and analysis is necessary to ensure the public health and safety in bathing waters.\n(g) The owners of semi-public bathing beaches shall be required to pay for the costs of testing, monitoring and analysis of bathing waters adjacent to such semi-public bathing beaches.\n(h) Local boards of health may enter into contractual agreements with owners of semi-public bathing beaches where the local board of health conducts testing, monitoring and analysis of such bathing waters.\n(i) A municipality or state agency may adopt sanitation standards and testing, monitoring, and analysis requirements for bathing waters within its jurisdiction that are stricter than the standards adopted by the department. In any case where a municipality or state agency adopts such stricter standards, any warning signs required by this section shall display the results of such stricter standards relative to the standards of the department.\n(j) The testing, monitoring and analysis of bathing waters that are under the control of any state agency shall be conducted by that state agency. All such state agencies shall meet the requirements set forth by this section and the regulations promulgated by the department.\n(k) The department may, subject to appropriation, award competitive grants to local boards of health in the form of a 50 per cent reimbursement for the testing, monitoring and analysis of bathing waters and to otherwise carry out the provisions of this section and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The department shall enter into a contractual agreement with a sole provider of testing services to be utilized by any state agency, and which may be utilized by any local board of health, to comply with the provisions of this section.\nThe department shall also ensure that the provisions of this section and the regulations promulgated thereunder are implemented in a cost effective manner by encouraging, where possible, regional approaches or other cost effective means of carrying out the purposes of this section.\n(l) The department shall enforce the provisions of this section in accordance with the penalty and enforcement provisions of section 127A."

(a) For purposes of this section, the following words shall have the following meanings:—\n''Non–English speaker'', a person who cannot speak or understand, or has difficulty with speaking or understanding, the English language because the speaker primarily or only uses a spoken language other than English.\n''Competent interpreter services'', interpreter services performed by a person who is fluent in English and in the language of a non–English speaker, who is trained and proficient in the skill and ethics of interpreting and who is knowledgeable about the specialized terms and concepts that need to be interpreted for purposes of receiving emergency care or treatment.\n(b) Every acute-care hospital, as defined in section 25B, shall provide competent interpreter services in connection with all emergency room services provided to every non–English speaker who is a patient or who seeks appropriate emergency care or treatment. Based on the volume and diversity of the non–English-speaking patients or persons seeking appropriate emergency care or treatment, each such hospital shall use reasonable judgment as to whether to employ, or to contract for the on-call use of one or more interpreters for particular languages when needed, or to use competent telephonic or televiewing interpreter services. However, such hospital shall only use competent telephonic or televiewing interpreter services in situations where there is either (1) no reasonable way to anticipate the need for employed or contracted interpreters for a particular language; or (2) there occurs, in a particular instance, an inability to provide competent interpreter services by an employed or contracted interpreter.\n(c) The receipt by any non–English speaker of interpreter services shall not be deemed the receipt of a ''public benefit'' under any provision of law restricting benefits or assistance on the basis of immigrant status.\n(d) Substantial compliance with the provisions of this section shall be a requirement of licensing or relicensing by the department under section 51, and the department may promulgate regulations under said section 51 for the implementation of this section.\n(e) Any non–English speaker, who is denied appropriate emergency health care services by an acute-care hospital by reason of such hospital's not having exercised reasonable judgment in making competent interpreter services available, as required by this section, or the attorney general upon receiving written notice from a regulating state agency that such hospital is substantially failing to comply with applicable interpreter requirements, shall have a right of action in the superior court against such hospital for declaratory or injunctive relief. A non–English speaker bringing such action shall not be required to exhaust any administrative remedies that may be available to him and may be awarded damages for any actual harm suffered, but at least $250 in damages shall be awarded for each violation, together with such costs, including expert fees and attorney's fees, as may be reasonably incurred in such action. Such action shall be brought within three years of any such failure to provide competent interpreter services."

All patients receiving an evaluation under subsection (b) shall receive, upon discharge, information on local and statewide treatment options, providers and other relevant information as deemed appropriate by the treating clinician.\n(d) If a person has received a substance use disorder evaluation within the past 3 months, further treatment and the need for a further evaluation shall be determined by the treating clinician according to best practices and procedures.\n(e) If a person under 18 years of age is ordered to undergo a substance use disorder evaluation, a parent or guardian shall be notified that the minor has suffered from an opioid-related overdose and that an evaluation has been ordered. A parent or guardian may be present when the findings of the evaluation are presented to the minor.\n(f) Upon discharge of a patient who experienced an opioid-related overdose, the acute-care hospital or satellite emergency facility shall notify the patient's primary care physician, if known, of the opioid-related overdose and any recommendations for further treatment.\n(g) Upon discharge of a patient who experienced an opioid-related overdose, the acute-care hospital, satellite emergency facility or emergency service program shall record the opioid-related overdose and substance use disorder evaluation in the patient's electronic medical record and shall make the evaluation directly accessible by other healthcare providers and facilities consistent with federal and state privacy requirements through a secure electronic medical record, health information exchange, or other similar software or information systems to: (i) improve ease of access and utilization of such data for treatment or diagnosis; (ii) support integration of such data within the electronic health records of a healthcare provider for purposes of treatment or diagnosis; or (iii) allow healthcare providers and their vendors to maintain such data for the purposes of compiling and visualizing such data within the electronic health records of a healthcare provider that supports treatment or diagnosis.\n(h) Nothing in this section shall interfere with an individual's right to refuse medical care."

In addition, notice of such rights shall be conspicuously posted in the facility.\nEach acute care hospital is hereby required, in accordance with applicable federal and state regulations, to create for each medicare patient determined to need assistance with post-hospital care, a written comprehensive, individualized, discharge plan consistent with medical discharge orders and identified patient needs. Said plan shall be developed with the participation of appropriate health care professionals, the medicare patient and, as appropriate, the patient's family or representative. The patient's representative shall be selected in accordance with department regulations. The discharge plan shall be given to the patient or the patient's representative at least twenty-four hours prior to discharge, except where such a requirement is not feasible due to a short length of stay. If said plan is revised due to the medical needs of the patient or due to a space becoming available in an appropriate institutional setting, the twenty-four hour requirement shall not apply to the amended plan, except insofar as such timing relates to the filing of a request for review with the advocacy office as hereinafter provided.\nThe discharge plan shall include at least the following information:\n(1) identification of the post-hospital services needed by the patient, including home health and homemaker services, and of the post-hospital social needs of the patient, as determined in accordance with procedures set forth by the department;\n(2) the services that have been arranged for the patient;\n(3) the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of service providers;\n(4) the service schedule as requested by the hospital;\n(5) medications prescribed and instructions for their use or verification that such information was provided separately;\n(6) scheduled follow-up medical appointments or verification that such information was provided separately; and\n(7) such other information as the department may require.\nEach hospital shall have a clear, concise front page on the discharge plan, which front page shall be written in large print and understandable language.

A signed or noted copy of the plan shall be retained in the patient's medical record. The patient's medical record shall also document that said plan was communicated orally to the patient or to the patient's representative.\nNo hospital may discharge a medicare patient without the patient or patient's representative having received, read and signed the front page of the discharge plan or upon decision of the advocacy office.\nIf a discharge plan cannot be agreed upon as a result of the meeting of the patient or the patient's representative, the discharge planning coordinator and the patient's physician, as provided for in this section, the patient or the patient's representative shall have the right to file a request for a review of said discharge plan with the department's advocacy office.

If the advocacy office does not approve the discharge plan, said office shall state the problems needing correction, and the hospital shall not charge the medicare patient for inpatient hospital services until an alternative plan is developed to resolve the problems set forth by the advocacy office. The requirements of this section relating to the initial discharge also shall apply to the alternative plan.\nIf a timely request for review has been filed with the advocacy office, the hospital shall not charge the medicare patient for inpatient hospital services furnished before noon of the day after said patient is notified by telephone or otherwise of the advocacy office's decision. If notice is made by telephone, the notice shall be made to both parties to the review and shall be followed by written notice as soon as possible.\nNo patient shall be discharged or transferred without a physician's order, except where such patient leaves against medical advice. No patient shall be discharged until the hospital has made all appropriate contacts to initiate the provisions for aftercare services.\nA medicare patient treated at the emergency room of an acute care hospital shall be provided with a discharge plan in accordance with the requirements of this section, with the exception of the right to request a review of such discharge plan by the advocacy office prior to such discharge.\nThe department shall conduct an evaluation as to whether the introduction of the medicare prospective payment system has affected the delivery of quality care to medicare beneficiaries including the appropriateness of admissions and discharges to acute care hospitals. Said department shall submit an interim report of its findings to the clerk of the house of representatives to the general court no later than March first, nineteen hundred and eighty-seven, and a final report not later than March first, nineteen hundred and eighty-eight, including any applicable recommendations for legislation arrived after consultation with the Massachusetts Hospital Association, the Massachusetts Medical Society, and others.

The department shall not seek information directly from hospitals when such information is available from other sources. The department shall protect the confidentiality of patient information provided by the hospitals. No data, findings, conclusions or reports developed by the department during or as a result of such evaluation from hospital/practitioner data shall be released without thirty days prior notice to such hospital. Comments by the hospital shall accompany the release of the data, findings, conclusions or reports."

For the purposes of this section, the words ''newborn infant'' shall mean an infant under three months of age, and the words ''hearing screening test'' shall mean a test to detect hearing thresholds of 30 decibels or greater in either ear in the speech frequency range.\nA hearing screening test shall be performed on all newborn infants in the commonwealth in the birthing hospital or birthing center, or in the hospital from which the newborn infant is discharged to home. Such test shall be performed before the newborn infant is discharged from the birthing center or hospital to the care of the parent or guardian, or as the department may by regulation provide; provided, however, that such test shall not be performed if the parents or guardian of the newborn infant object to the test based upon the sincerely held religious beliefs of the parent or guardian. The hospital or birthing center shall inform a parent or guardian of the newborn infant and the newborn infant's primary care provider of such infant's failure to pass the test, or if such infant was not successfully tested. Such notification shall occur prior to discharge whenever possible, and in any case no later than ten days following discharge. The hospital or birthing center so informing the parent and provider shall provide information regarding appropriate follow-up for a screening failure or a missed screening.\nThe cost of providing the newborn hearing screening test shall be a covered benefit reimbursable by all health insurers, except for supplemental policies which only provide coverage for specific diseases, hospital indemnity, Medicare supplement, or other supplemental policies.

Such centers shall maintain suitable audiological support, medical and education referral practices in order to receive such approval. If no third party payer is liable for such cost, the commonwealth shall make reimbursement for the cost of such follow-up diagnostic examinations.\nThere is hereby established an advisory committee for a statewide newborn hearing screening program consisting of the following members to be appointed by the commissioner: a representative of the health insurance industry; a pediatrician or family practitioner; an otolaryngologist; a neonatologist; a nurse representing newborn nurseries; two audiologists; a teacher of the deaf and hard of hearing; a representative of the commonwealth's early intervention program; a representative of the department; two parents of children who are deaf or hard of hearing; and one deaf and one hard of hearing adult to be designated by the Massachusetts commission for the deaf and hard of hearing.

The department shall issue for a term of two years, and shall renew for like terms, a license, subject to revocation by it for cause, to any person whom it deems responsible and suitable to establish or maintain an infirmary maintained in a town, a convalescent or nursing home, a rest home, a charitable home for the aged or an intermediate care facility for persons with an intellectual disability, which meets the requirements of the department established in accordance with its rules and regulations; provided, however, that each convalescent or nursing home and each intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded shall be inspected at least once a year.\nIn the case of the transfer of ownership of a convalescent or nursing home, infirmary maintained in a town, rest home, charitable home for the aged or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded, a prospective transferee, in the capacity of a prospective licensee, shall submit a notice of intent to acquire such a facility to the department at least ninety days prior to the transfer of ownership. The notice of intent shall be on a form supplied by the department and shall be deemed complete upon submission of all information which the department requires on the notice of intent form and is reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. Within ninety days of the submission of a completed notice of intent form, the department shall determine whether such prospective licensee is responsible and suitable for licensure. Requests by the department for information other than the information required on the notice of intent form shall not extend the ninety day period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the department with the consent of said prospective licensee may extend the ninety day determination period for one additional period not to exceed thirty days.\nFor purposes of this section, the department's determination of responsibility and suitability shall be limited to the following factors:\n(i) the criminal history of the prospective licensee, or any officer, director, shareholder or general or limited partner thereof, to which the department has been granted access or certification or may be subsequently granted access or certification by the department of criminal justice information services;\n(ii) the financial capacity of the prospective licensee to operate the health care facility in accordance with applicable laws;\n(iii) the history of the prospective licensee in providing long term care in the commonwealth, measured by compliance with applicable statutes and regulations governing the operation of long term care facilities; and\n(iv) the history of the prospective licensee in providing long term care in states other than the commonwealth, if any, measured by compliance with the applicable statutes and regulations governing the operation of long term care facilities in said states.\nThe prospective licensee shall be deemed responsible and suitable upon the expiration of the ninety day period, or upon the expiration of said period as extended, if the department fails to notify said prospective licensee in writing of its decision within the ninety day period or within the expiration of the extension period, whichever is applicable.\nUpon determination by the department that the prospective licensee is responsible and suitable for licensure, or upon the failure of the department to notify said prospective licensee in writing of its decision within the required period, and upon a transfer of ownership, the prospective licensee may file an application for a license which shall have the effect of a license until the department takes final action on the application.\nNo transfer of ownership of a convalescent or nursing home, infirmary maintained in a town, rest home, charitable home for the aged or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded shall occur unless the prospective licensee has been deemed suitable for licensure in accordance with the provisions of this section.\nThe department shall not reduce the number of beds originally approved by it in granting a license for a convalescent or nursing home or rest home upon the transfer of ownership of said convalescent or nursing home or rest home from one licensee to another, unless the public safety requires it.\nAny applicant for an original or renewal license who is aggrieved, on the basis of a written disapproval of a certificate of inspection by the head of the local fire department or by the office of public safety and inspections of the division of occupational licensure, may, within 30 days from such disapproval, appeal in writing to the division of occupational licensure. With respect to certificates of inspection that the division of health care quality of the department of public health has the sole authority to issue, an applicant may, within 30 days from disapproval of a certificate of inspection, appeal in writing to the department of public health only. Failure to either approve or disapprove within 30 days, after a written request by an applicant, shall be deemed a disapproval.\nIf the division of occupational licensure or, where applicable, the department of public health approves the issuance of a certificate of inspection, it shall forthwith be issued by the agency that failed to approve. If said department disapproves, the applicant may appeal therefrom to the superior court. Failure of said department to either approve or disapprove the issuance of a certificate of inspection within thirty days after receipt of an appeal shall be deemed a disapproval.

The inspections herein provided shall be in addition to any other inspections required by law.\nIn the case of new construction, or major addition, alteration, or repair with respect to any facility subject to this section, preliminary architectural plans and specifications and final architectural plans and specifications shall be submitted to a qualified person designated by the commissioner. Written approval of the final architectural plans and specifications shall be obtained from said person prior to said new construction, or major addition, alteration, or repair.\nThe licensee of every convalescent or nursing home or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded shall file with the department, at the time his license is due for renewal, a sworn statement of the names and addresses of any person with an ownership or control interest in the home or in the real property occupied and used as such home or facility. As used herein, the phrase ''person with an ownership or control interest'' shall have the definition set forth in 42 USC Sec. 1320a–3 of the Social Security Act and in regulations promulgated hereunder by the department.\nFor the purposes of this section ''changes in ownership'' of a convalescent or nursing home, infirmary, rest home, charitable home for the aged or intermediate care facility for persons with an intellectual disability shall, in the case of a corporation, mean transfer of a majority of the stock thereof, and in all other cases, a transfer of a majority interest therein.\nThe department shall notify the secretary of elder affairs forthwith of the pendency of any proceeding of any public hearing or of any action to be taken under this section relating to any convalescent or nursing home, rest home, infirmary maintained in a town, or charitable home for the aged.

Any receiver appointed under this paragraph may be removed by the court upon a showing that the receiver is not diligently carrying out the work necessary to bring the property into compliance with the code, or that it is in the best interest of any tenants residing in the property that removal occur.\nNo receiver shall be appointed until the receiver furnishes a bond or such other surety and provides proof of such liability insurance as the court deems sufficient in the circumstances of the case. Upon appointment, the receiver shall promptly repair the property and maintain it in a safe and healthful condition.

Any excess of income in the hands of the receiver shall then be applied to payments due any mortgagee or lienor of record.\nNothing in this section shall be deemed to relieve the owner of property of any civil or criminal liability or any duty imposed by reason of acts or omissions of the owner, nor shall appointment of a receiver suspend any obligation the owner or any other person may have for payment of taxes, of any operating or maintenance expense, or of mortgages or liens, or for repair of the premises.\nThe receiver shall be liable for injuries to persons and property to the same extent as the owner would have been liable; however, such liability shall be limited to the assets and income of the receivership, including any proceeds of insurance purchased by the receiver in its capacity as receiver. The receiver shall in no instance be personally liable for actions or inactions within the scope of the receiver's capacity as receiver. No suit shall be brought against the receiver except as approved by the court which appointed the receiver. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the right of tenants to raise any counterclaims or defenses in any summary process or other action regarding possession brought by a receiver.\nThe remedies set forth herein shall be available to condominium unit owners and tenants in condominium units.

    "section_text": "Section 197: Duty of residential premises owners; interim control measures; abatement or containment of paint, plaster or other accessible structural material containing lead\nSection 197. (a) Whenever a child under six years of age resides in any premises in which any paint, plaster or other accessible structural material contains dangerous levels of lead, the owner shall abate or contain said paint, plaster or other accessible structural materials in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b) or (c). Except as provided in section one hundred and ninety-seven D, whenever any such premises containing said dangerous levels of lead undergoes a change of ownership and as a result a child under six years of age will become or will continue to be a resident therein, the new owner shall have ninety days to contain or abate said paint, plaster or other accessible structural material as required by this section, so as to make the premises in compliance with the provisions of sections one hundred and eighty-nine A to one hundred and ninety-nine B, inclusive.\n(b) Owners shall be eligible to contain and control paint, plaster or other accessible structural materials containing dangerous levels of lead on an interim basis until achieving full compliance as set out in subsection (c), in accordance with measures defined in an emergency lead management plan, and a letter of interim control issued by a licensed inspector pursuant thereto. If, in the determination of a licensed inspector, the condition of such premises make it ineligible for interim control under an emergency lead management plan, the owner shall be required to satisfy the requirements of subsection (c) and receive a letter of full compliance, provided that secured lending institutions shall be governed by the provisions of section one hundred and ninety-seven D.\nThe director shall promulgate regulations to establish a program of interim control measures that are eligible to be used in emergency lead management plans to address urgent lead paint hazards that include, but are not limited to, paint containing a dangerous level of lead that is chipping, peeling or flaking, and highly lead-contaminated dust. Interim control measures shall be used to address said urgent lead hazards until a letter of full compliance has been obtained pursuant to subsection (c), and all emergency lead management plans shall include full compliance in accord with subsection (c) as their ultimate goal. Only in the instance of a waiver by the department, shall an owner be eligible for an emergency lead management plan and letter of interim control for premises in which a lead-poisoned child resides. The owner of premises containing a dangerous level of lead may obtain approval for an emergency lead management plan from an inspector licensed under section one hundred and ninety-seven B after an inspection and assessment of the premises by said inspector, and for a letter of interim control by such a licensed inspector certifying compliance with the emergency lead management plan and regulations promulgated by the director under this section. Said regulations shall, at minimum, include the following:\n(2) abatement or containment of all peeling paint and installing safeguards to protect intact paint, plaster or other accessible structural material on both interior and exterior surfaces and fixtures;\n(3) removal of lead dust using specified methods, unless the initial inspection indicates that there is no peeling paint and that surface dust levels meet specified standards;\n(4) provision of educational materials prepared by the department to tenants occupying the affected premises, as well as compliance with the tenant notification provisions of section one hundred and ninety-seven A;\n(5) correction of any other lead paint condition which the director determines poses an urgent risk of lead poisoning to children under age six;\n(6) requirement that all interim control work performed under this section comply with the requirements for use of licensed deleading contractors or for the abatement and containment activities by property owners contained in the regulations promulgated by the director pursuant to subsection (d); and\n(7) a final inspection by a licensed inspector, including testing to ensure that surface dust levels are within specified limits for particular surfaces.\nA letter of interim control shall expire at the end of one year from the date of its issuance, and may be renewed once, for an additional one-year period, upon reinspection and recertification pursuant to this section by a licensed lead inspector, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the director. The revocation and subsequent recertification of a letter of interim control shall not extend the initial letter of interim control beyond the time period allowed by this section. An emergency lead management plan and letter of interim control shall be issued for the premises, not its owner, and shall remain in effect should ownership of the premises be transferred during the existence of the emergency lead management plan and the letter of interim control. A subsequent owner of premises under a pre-existing emergency lead management plan and letter of interim control shall be responsible for complying with the terms of said plan and letter. In no case shall premises be subject to an emergency lead management plan and letter of interim control for longer than two years.\nA letter of interim control shall be revocable by operation of law upon occurrence of either of the following conditions: (i) expiration by its own term; (ii) upon the failure of the owner to bring the unit into compliance, or keep the unit in compliance, as required by this paragraph. If a licensed lead inspector finds that the premises contains peeling paint or otherwise fails to meet the standards of the emergency lead management plan and the letter of interim control, said inspector shall notify the owner of the premises, the director, the local code enforcement agency or board of health of said failure. The owner shall bring the premises into compliance with the emergency lead management plan and the letter of interim control within fourteen days of being notified to do so by the director, local code enforcement agency or board of health or licensed lead inspector, or within such greater period of time as may be allowed by the director, local code enforcement agency or board of health, or by judicial order.\n(1) All peeling paint, plaster or other structural material containing dangerous levels of lead, on both interior and exterior surfaces and fixtures shall be abated or contained.\n(2) Intact paint, plaster or other accessible structural material containing dangerous levels of lead shall be contained or abated on door frames below the five foot level and four inches from all edges; stair rail spindles; stair treads from the lip to the riser on the bottom and four inches back from the lip on the top of the tread; doors below the five foot level and four inches from all edges; stair rails; porch railings; and all other exterior and interior surfaces and fixtures that may be readily mouthed by, or are otherwise accessible to, children. The director may, by regulation, require that in order to maintain the stability of any encapsulants used as a containing agent as part of the process to achieve full compliance, intact paint, plaster or other accessible structural material containing dangerous levels of lead be contained beyond the height of five feet and more than four inches from all edges.\n(3) Peeling and intact paint, plaster or other accessible structural material containing dangerous levels of lead shall be contained or abated, on the interior and exterior surfaces of windows having sills below the five foot level when surfaces are either movable or impact on movable surfaces. Such surfaces shall include, but not be limited to, interior and exterior window sashes, window sills, and mullions; window wells and parting beads; headers on the lower side of the window that impact on the sash; and interior and exterior inner sides of the window casings that impact on the sash.\n(4) Exterior paint containing dangerous levels of lead shall be contained or abated pursuant to regulations issued by the director, after consultation with the department of environmental protection specifying acceptable methods and prescribing encapsulation, shrouding or other containment methods; provided, however, that the director may ban sandblasting of exterior paint where he determines that children under six years of age are at risk of exposure to dangerous levels of lead. The use of potassium or sodium hydroxide in removing exterior lead-based paint shall be prohibited. Such regulations shall recommend appropriate methods of containment or abatement for properties listed on the state register of historic places. Local boards of health or code enforcement agencies shall enforce compliance with this regulation.\n(5) Paint chips, dust and other debris created by the containment or abatement of interior or exterior paint shall be cleaned up by the person performing the containment or abatement in conformance with regulations promulgated by the director.\nUpon the determination of a licensed inspector that the premises fully comply with the requirements of this subsection, said inspector shall issue a letter of full compliance for said premises. The director shall prepare one or more standard formats for letters of full compliance which may be revised from time to time as appropriate. All licensed inspectors shall use such standardized formats in issuing letters of full compliance.\nIf a tenant believes that the premises fail to meet the standards of the letter of compliance or a licensed lead inspector finds that the premises fails to meet the standards of the letter of full compliance, said tenant or inspector shall notify the owner of the premises, the director, the local code enforcement agency or board of health of said failure. The owner shall ensure that the condition of the premises meets the standards required by the letter of full compliance within fourteen days of being notified to do so by the director, local code enforcement agency or board of health or licensed lead inspector, or within such greater period of time as may be allowed by the director, local code enforcement agency or board of health, or by judicial order.\nNo claim for strict liability may be brought under section one hundred and ninety-nine against an owner by an occupant or former occupant of premises for which a letter of full compliance has been issued and is in effect in accordance with this subsection.\n(d) Containment or abatement, and daily and final cleanup of paint, plaster or other accessible structural material required under this section, whether undertaken for full compliance or as an interim measure under an emergency lead management plan, shall be conducted only by a contractor licensed by the department of labor standards, except that the owner of premises or the owner's agent, acting pursuant to regulations promulgated by the director specifying the conditions under which owners or their agents may undertake such containment or abatement, need not be licensed to engage in such activities. Any person who is not licensed may undertake containment or abatement activities only after successful completion of a course of instruction approved by the commissioner in consultation with the director detailing the proper methods and health hazards of containment or abatement and final cleanup of paint, plaster or other accessible structural material; provided further, that all containment or abatement activities by an unlicensed person shall be inspected and approved after completion by a licensed inspector. Such regulations shall include, but not be limited to, the removal of doors, windows, woodwork or other elements or fixtures containing dangerous levels of lead and shall address the presence of residents during deleading and cleanup; provided, that in no instance shall paint containing such dangerous levels of lead be stripped or scraped from the doors, windows, woodwork, elements or fixtures while residents are on the premises. The director shall make available to the public standard guidelines relative to owner deleading activities made permissible pursuant to this section.\n(e) The director may waive or alter any requirements of this section concerning the required containment or abatement of paint, plaster or other accessible structural material on specified surfaces and fixtures or specified substrates upon a finding by the director that no substantial risk is posed to the health of children under six years of age by the continued presence of such paint, plaster or other accessible structural material.\n(f) Under no circumstances shall repainting with a non-lead based paint, without containment or abatement of the offending paint, plaster or other accessible structural material, constitute compliance with either subsection (b) or (c).\n(g) No person shall occupy the premises while containment or abatement of dangerous levels of lead paint, plaster or other accessible structural materials is taking place and until such time as the premises has been cleaned up and found to be in compliance with this section, except pursuant to regulations issued by the director. Such regulations shall provide that persons may occupy the premises pursuant to specified conditions established on a case-by-case basis by the director or local board of health or code enforcement agency upon a finding that such occupancy will not endanger or materially impair the health or the well-being of any occupant; provided, however, that pregnant women and children under the age of six are not permitted to occupy the dwelling unit during deleading activities.\n(h) Any owner undertaking to abate or contain dangerous levels of lead in any dwelling unit may, at the owner's option, reasonably delay the commencement of the tenancy until a letter of compliance or interim control certificate has been issued; provided, that no duly executed lease exists between owner and tenant; and provided, further, that no such delay shall exceed thirty days. During any such period of delay of occupancy the prospective tenant shall bear any living expenses. Should the owner decide to bring any residential premises into compliance with the provisions of sections one hundred and eighty-nine A to one hundred and ninety-nine B, inclusive, while a tenant is occupying a dwelling unit, the owner shall have the right to move the tenant to a substitute dwelling unit upon reasonable notice; provided, however, that the owner pays reasonable moving expenses and any use and occupancy charges for a substitute dwelling unit which exceed the rent for the vacated dwelling unit for which the tenant remains responsible. A substitute dwelling unit shall be defined as one that does not cause undue economic or personal hardship to the tenant. If the tenant fails to accept the substitute dwelling unit selected by the owner during such period of time reasonably required to bring the vacated dwelling unit into compliance with the provisions of sections one hundred and eighty-nine A to one hundred and ninety-nine B, inclusive, the owner shall have no obligation to reimburse the tenant for any expense or inconvenience other than moving expenses and any use and occupancy charges for the substitute dwelling unit selected by the owner which may exceed the rent for the vacated dwelling unit."

The designated caregiver shall be provided with access to the patient's health information and discharge plan, when applicable, if the patient or the court-appointed guardian for the patient has authorized a release of such information in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the commonwealth's privacy laws and regulations and in accordance with the hospital's established procedures for obtaining the authorization.\nIf a patient is unconscious or incapacitated upon entry into a hospital and does not have a court-appointed guardian, the hospital shall provide the patient, upon recovery of consciousness and capacity, with the opportunity to designate a caregiver.

Whenever the attorney general has reason to believe that any person is using or is about to use any method, act, or practice declared by section two to be unlawful, and that proceedings would be in the public interest, he may bring an action in the name of the commonwealth against such person to restrain by temporary restraining order or preliminary or permanent injunction the use of such method, act or practice. The action may be brought in the superior court of the county in which such person resides or has his principal place of business, or the action may be brought in the superior court of Suffolk county with the consent of the parties or if the person has no place of business within the commonwealth. If more than one person is joined as a defendant, such action may be brought in the superior court of the county where any one defendant resides or has his principal place of business, or in Suffolk county. Said court may issue temporary restraining orders or preliminary or permanent injunctions and make such other orders or judgments as may be necessary to restore to any person who has suffered any ascertainable loss by reason of the use or employment of such unlawful method, act or practice any moneys or property, real or personal, which may have been acquired by means of such method, act, or practice. If the court finds that a person has employed any method, act or practice which he knew or should have known to be in violation of said section two, the court may require such person to pay to the commonwealth a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars for each such violation and also may require the said person to pay the reasonable costs of investigation and litigation of such violation, including reasonable attorneys' fees. If the court finds any method, act, or practice unlawful with regard to any security or any contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery as defined in section two, the court may issue such orders or judgments as may be necessary to restore any person who has suffered any ascertainable loss of any moneys or property, real or personal, or up to three but not less than two times that amount if the court finds that the use of the act or practice was a willful violation of said section two, a civil penalty to be paid to the commonwealth of not more than five thousand dollars for each such violation, and also may require said person to pay the reasonable costs of investigation and litigation of such violation, including reasonable attorneys fees.\nAt least five days prior to the commencement of any action brought under this section, except when a temporary restraining order is sought, the attorney general shall notify the person of his intended action, and give the person an opportunity to confer with the attorney general in person or by counsel or other representative as to the proposed action. Such notice shall be given the person by mail, postage prepaid, to his usual place of business, or if he has no usual place of business, to his last known address.\nAny person who violates the terms of an injunction or other order issued under this section shall forfeit and pay to the commonwealth a civil penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars for each violation. For the purposes of this section, the court issuing such an injunction or order shall retain jurisdiction, and the cause shall be continued, and in such case the attorney general acting in the name of the commonwealth may petition for recovery of such civil penalty."
